The Importance of Financial Markets 
and Institutions
In the previous chapter, we explained why corporations need to be good at finance in 
order to survive and prosper. All corporations face important investment and financing 
decisions. But, of course, those decisions are not made in a vacuum. They are made in 
a financial environment. That environment has two main segments: financial markets 
and financial institutions.
Businesses have to go to financial markets and institutions for the financing they 
need to grow. When they have a surplus of cash, and no need for immediate financing, 
they have to invest the cash, for example, in bank accounts or in securities. Let’s take 
Apple Computer Inc. as an example.
