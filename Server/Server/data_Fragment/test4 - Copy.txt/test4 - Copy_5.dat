stock price should be less subject to an overemphasis on short-term results than one that simply 
maximizes profits. (LO1-5)
17. Goals of the Firm. Fritz is risk-averse and is content with a relatively low but safe return on his

 Shareholders want managers to maximize the _____ of their investments. The firm faces a 
trade-off. Either it can invest its cash in _____ or it can give the cash back to _____ in the form 
of a(n) _____ and they can invest it in _____. Shareholders want the company to invest in _____ 
only if the _____ is _____ than they could earn for themselves in equivalent risk investments. 
The return that shareholders could earn for themselves is therefore the _____ for the firm.

b. Modify the firm’s investment plan to help shareholders achieve a particular time pattern of 
consumption.

directors notes that the company can easily borrow the required investment at 7%. “It’s 
simple,” he says. “If the bank lends us money at 7%, then our cost of capital must be 7%. 
The project’s return is higher than the cost of capital, so let’s move ahead.” How would you 
respond? (LO1-5)

Then the carbon is sold to the government. (LO1-5)
a. Suppose the government guarantees the price of carbon. At this price, the payoff after 1 year 
is $115,000 for sure. How would you determine the opportunity cost of capital for this 
investment?
b. Suppose instead that the sequestered carbon has to be sold on the London Carbon Exchange. 
Carbon prices have been extremely volatile, but Pollution Busters’ CFO learns that average
