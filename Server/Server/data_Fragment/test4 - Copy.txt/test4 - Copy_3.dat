corporation’s accounting procedures and results.
Activist Shareholders Institutional shareholders, including pension funds, have 
become more active in monitoring management and pushing for changes. CEOs have 
been forced out as a result, including the CEOs of JCPenney, Procter & Gamble, Barnes 
& Noble, Citigroup, Yahoo!, and Carnival. Boards outside the United States, which 
have traditionally been more management-friendly, have also become more willing to 
replace underperformers. The list of foreign companies with CEO departures includes 
Barclays, Carrefour, Siemens, Barrick, and Rio Tinto.
Although U.S. corporations typically have thousands of individual shareholders, 
they often also have blockholders, that is, investors who own 5%, 10%, or more of 
outstanding shares. The blockholders may include wealthy individuals or families—
for example, descendants of a founder. They may also include other corporations, 
pension funds, or foundations.9
 When a 5% blockholder calls, the CFO answers.

10 Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (New York: Random House, 
1937; first published 1776), p. 14.
11 Shareholders value integrity. Firms that are regarded as trustworthy by their employees and that are voted as 
good places to work tend to be more highly valued by investors and to perform better. See A. Edmans, “Does 
the Stock Market Fully Value Intangibles? Employee Satisfaction and Equity Prices,” Journal of Financial 
Economics 101, no. 3 (September 2011), pp. 621–640; and L. Guiso, P. Sapienza, and L. Zingales, “The Value 
of Corporate Culture,” Journal of Financial Economics 117, no. 1 (July 2015), pp. 60–76.
Disgruntled shareholders can also take the “Wall Street Walk” by selling out and 
moving on to other investments. The Wall Street Walk can send a powerful message. 
If enough shareholders bail out, the stock price tumbles, which damages top managers’ compensation and reputation.
Takeovers The Wall Street Walk also opens the door for takeovers. The further the 
stock price falls, the easier it is for another company to buy up the majority of shares 
and take over. The old management team is then likely to find itself out on the street. 
We discuss takeovers in Chapter 21.
Information for Investors Corporate governance can’t work unless outside investors 
get detailed, up-to-date information. If a firm is transparent—if investors can see its true 
profitability and prospects—then problems will show up right away in a falling stock 
price. That in turn generates extra scrutiny from security analysts, bond rating agencies, 
and banks and other lenders, who keep an eagle eye on the progress of their borrowers.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sets accounting and reporting standards for public companies. We cover accounting and finance in Chapter 3.
Chapter 1 is not the right place for a worldwide tour of corporate governance. But be 
aware that governance laws, regulations, and practice vary. The differences are more 
dramatic in continental Europe and Japan than in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other English-speaking countries. In Germany, for example, banks often control 
large blocks of stock and can push hard for changes in the management or strategy of 
poorly performing companies. (Banks in the United States are prohibited from large or 
permanent holdings of the stock of nonfinancial corporations.) Large German firms also 
have two boards of directors: the supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) and the management 
board (Vorstand). Half of the supervisory board’s members are elected by employees. 
Some French firms also have two boards, one including employee representatives.
1.6 The Ethics of Maximizing Value
Shareholders want managers to maximize the market value of their shares. But perhaps this begs the question: Is it desirable for managers to act in the narrow, selfish 
interest of their shareholders? Does a focus on shareholder value mean that the managers must act as greedy mercenaries riding roughshod over widows and orphans?
Most of this book is devoted to financial policies that increase value. None of these 
policies requires galloping over widows and orphans. In most instances, there is little 
conflict between doing well (maximizing value) and doing good. The first step in doing 
well is doing good by your customers. Here is how Adam Smith put the case in 1776:
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our 
dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity 
but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.10
Profitable firms are those with satisfied customers and loyal employees; firms with 
dissatisfied customers and a disgruntled workforce will probably end up with declining profits and a low stock price.11
Of course, ethical issues do arise in business as in other walks of life. When the 
stakes are high, it is often tempting for managers to cut corners. Laws and regulations 
seek to prevent managers from undertaking dishonest actions. But written rules and 
laws can help only so much. In business, as in other day-to-day affairs, there are also

Chapter 1 Goals and Governance of the Corporation 19

unwritten rules of behavior. They are reinforced because good managers know that 
their firm’s reputation is one of its most important assets, and therefore playing fair 
and keeping one’s word are simply good business practices. Thus financial deals are 
regularly sealed by a handshake, and each side knows that the other will not renege 
later if things turn sour.
Reputation is particularly important in finance. If you buy a well-known brand in a 
supermarket, you can be fairly sure of what you are getting. But in financial transactions, the other party often has more information than you, and it is less easy to be sure 
of the quality of what you are buying. Therefore, honest financial firms seek to build 
long-term relationships with their customers and to establish a name for fair dealing 
and financial integrity. Major banks and securities firms protect their reputations.
When something happens to undermine reputations, the costs can be enormous. 
Volkswagen (VW) is a recent case in point. VW had installed secret software that cut 
back pollution from its diesel cars, but only when the cars were tested. Actual pollution in regular driving was much higher—and far in excess of legal maximums. 
Discovery of the software scandal in 2015 caused a tidal wave of opprobrium. VW’s 
stock price dropped by 35%. Its CEO was fired. VW diesel vehicles piled up unsold on 
car dealers’ lots. Potential fines imposed by the U.S. and European governments could 
be enormous. VW set aside $7.3 billion to cover costs and losses, but some analysts 
viewed this amount as much too low.
Charlatans and swindlers sometimes prey on individual investors, especially in 
booming markets. (It’s only “when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been 
swimming naked.”12) The tide went out in 2008 and a number of frauds were exposed. 
One notorious example was the Ponzi scheme run by the disgraced financier Bernard 
Madoff (pronounced “Made-off ”).13 Individuals and institutions invested around 
$20 billion with Madoff and were told that their investments had grown to $65 billion. 
That figure turned out to be completely fictitious. (It’s not clear what Madoff did with 
all this money, but much of it was apparently paid out to early investors in the scheme to 
create an impression of superior investment performance.) With hindsight, the investors 
should not have trusted Madoff or the financial advisers who steered money to him.
Madoff’s Ponzi scheme was (we hope) a once-in-a-lifetime event. (Ponzi schemes 
pop up frequently, but few have approached the scope and duration of Madoff’s.) 
It was astonishingly unethical and illegal and was bound to end in tears. Needless to 
say, it was not designed to add value for investors.

The Great Albanian 
Ponzi Scheme
12 The quotation is from Warren Buffett’s annual letter to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, March 2008.
13 Ponzi schemes are named after Charles Ponzi, who founded an investment company in 1920 that promised 
investors unbelievably high returns. He was soon deluged with funds from investors in New England, taking in 
$1 million during one 3-hour period. Ponzi invested only about $30 of the money that he raised. But he used part of 
the cash provided by later investors to pay generous dividends to the original investors, thus promoting the illusion 
of high profits and quick payoffs. Within months the scheme collapsed and Ponzi started a 5-year prison sentence.
Without knowing anything about the personal ethics of the owners, which 
company would you trust more to keep its word in a business deal?
a. Harry’s Hardware has been in business for 50 years. Harry’s grandchildren, 
now almost adults, plan to take over and operate the business. Successful 
hardware stores depend on long-term loyal customers.
b. Victor’s Videos just opened for business. It rents a storefront in a strip mall 
and has financed its inventory with a bank loan. Victor has little of his own 
money invested in the business. Video shops usually command little 
customer loyalty.

But sometimes raids can enhance shareholder value. For 
example, in 2012 and 2013, Relational Investors teamed up 
with the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CSTRS, 
a pension fund) to try to force Timken Co. to split into two 
separate companies, one for its steel business and one for its 
industrial bearings business. Relational and CSTRS believed 
that Timken’s combination of unrelated businesses was unfocused and inefficient. Timken management responded that 
breakup would “deprive our shareholders of long-run value—
all in an attempt to create illusory short-term gains through 
financial engineering.” But Timken’s stock price rose at the 
prospect of a breakup, and a nonbinding shareholder vote on 
Relational’s proposal attracted a 53% majority. Finally in 2014 
Timken spun off its steel business in a new corporation, 
Timken Steel.
How do you draw the ethical line in such examples? Was 
Relational Investors a “raider” (sounds bad) or an “activist 
investor” (sounds good)? Breaking up a portfolio of businesses can create difficult adjustments and job losses. Some 
stakeholders lose. But shareholders and the overall economy 
can gain if businesses are managed more efficiently.
Tax Avoidance
In 2012 it was revealed that during the 14 years that Starbucks 
had operated in the United Kingdom, it paid hardly any taxes. 
Public outrage led to a boycott of Starbucks shops, and the 
company responded by promising that it would voluntarily 
pay to the taxman about $16 million more than it was required 
to pay by law. Several months later, a U.S. Senate committee 
investigating tax avoidance by U.S. technology firms reported 
that Apple had used a “highly questionable” web of offshore 
entities to avoid billions of dollars of U.S. taxes.
Multinational companies, such as Starbucks and Apple, 
could reduce their tax bills using legal techniques with exotic 
names such as the “Dutch Sandwich,” “Double Irish,” and 
“Check-the-Box.” But the public outcry over the revelations 
suggested that many believed that use of these techniques, 
though legal, was unethical. If they were unethical, that leaves 
an awkward question: How do companies decide which tax 
schemes are ethical and which are not? Can a company act in 
shareholders’ interest if it voluntarily pays more taxes than it 
is legally obligated to pay?
*We need not go into the mechanics of short sales here, but note that the seller 
is obligated to buy back the security, even if its price skyrockets far above what 
he or she sold it for. As the saying goes, “He who sells what isn’t his’n, buys it 
back or goes to prison.”
†The story of Paulson’s trade is told in G. Zuckerman, The Greatest Trade Ever 
(Broadway Business, 2009). The trade was controversial for reasons beyond 
short-selling. Scan the nearby Beyond the Page icon “Goldman Sachs causes a 
ruckus” to learn more.
Short-Selling
Investors who take short positions are betting that securities 
will fall in price. Usually they do this by borrowing the security, 
selling it for cash, and then waiting in the hope that they will 
be able to buy it back cheaply.* In 2007, hedge fund manager 
John Paulson took a huge short position in mortgage-backed 
securities. The bet paid off, and that year Paulson’s trade 
made a profit of $1 billion for his fund.†
Was Paulson’s trade unethical? Some believe not only that 
he was profiting from the misery that resulted from the crash 
in mortgage-backed securities, but that his short trades 
accentuated the collapse. It is certainly true that short-sellers 
have never been popular. For example, following the crash of 
1929, one commentator compared short-selling to the ghoulishness of “creatures who, at all great earthquakes and fires, 
spring up to rob broken homes and injured and dead 
humans.”
Short-selling in the stock market is the Wall Street Walk on 
steroids. Not only do short-sellers sell all the shares they may 
have previously owned, but they borrow more shares and sell 
them too, hoping to buy them back for less when the stock 
price falls. Poorly performing companies are natural targets 
for short-sellers, and the companies’ incumbent managers 
naturally complain, often bitterly. Governments sometimes 
listen to such complaints. For example, in 2008 the U.S. 
government temporarily banned short sales of financial 
stocks in an attempt to halt their decline.
But defendants of short-selling argue that selling securities that one believes are overpriced is no less legitimate 
than buying those that appear underpriced. The object of a 
well-functioning market is to set the correct stock prices, not 
always higher prices. Why impede short-selling if it conveys 
truly bad news, puts pressure on poor performers, and helps 
corporate governance work?
Corporate Raiders
In the movie Pretty Woman, Richard Gere plays the role of an 
asset stripper, Edward Lewis. He buys companies, takes them 
apart, and sells the bits for more than he paid for the total 
package. In the movie Wall Street, Gordon Gekko buys a 
failing airline, Blue Star, in order to break it up and sell the 
bits. Real corporate raiders may not be as ruthless as Edward 
Lewis or Gordon Gekko, but they do target companies whose 
assets can be profitably split up and redeployed.
This has led some to complain that raiders seek to carve 
up established companies, often leaving them with heavy 
debt burdens, basically in order to get rich quick. One 
German politician has likened them to “swarms of locusts that 
fall on companies, devour all they can, and then move on.”

14 The careers are fictitious but based on the actual experiences of several of the authors’ students.
1.7 Careers in Finance
Well over 1 million people work in the financial services industry in the United States, 
and many others work as financial managers in corporations. We can’t tell you what 
each one does all day, but we can give you some idea of the variety of careers in finance. 
The nearby box summarizes the experience of a small sample of recent graduates.14
We explained earlier that corporations face two principal financial decisions: the 
investment decision and the financing decision. Therefore, as a newly recruited financial analyst, you may help to analyze a major new investment project. Or you may 
instead help to raise the money to pay for it, perhaps by negotiating a bank loan or by 
arranging to lease the plant and equipment. Other financial analysts work on shortterm finance, managing collection and investment of the company’s cash or checking 
whether customers are likely to pay their bills. Financial analysts are also involved in 
monitoring and controlling risk. For example, they may help to arrange insurance for 
the firm’s plant and equipment, or they may assist with the purchase and sale of 
options, futures, and other exotic tools for managing risk.
Instead of working in the finance department of a corporation, you may join a 
financial institution. The largest employers are banks. Banks collect deposits and 
relend the cash to corporations and individuals. If you join a bank, you may start in a 
branch office, where individuals and small businesses come to deposit cash or to seek 
a loan. You could also work in the head office, helping to analyze a $500 million loan 
to a large corporation.
Banks do many things in addition to lending money, and they probably provide a 
greater variety of jobs than other financial institutions. For example, if you work in the 
cash management department of a large bank, you may help companies to transfer 
huge sums of money electronically as wages, taxes, and payments to suppliers. Banks 
also buy and sell foreign exchange, so you could find yourself working in front of one 
of those computer screens in a foreign exchange trading room. Another glamorous 
bank job is in the derivatives group, which helps companies to manage their risk by 
buying and selling options, futures, and so on. This is where the mathematicians and 
the computer buffs thrive.
Investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, help companies sell 
their securities to investors. They also have large corporate finance departments that 
assist firms in mergers and acquisitions. When firms issue securities or try to take over 
another firm, a lot of money is at stake and the firms may need to move fast. Thus, 
working for an investment bank can be a high-pressure activity with long hours. It can 
also pay very well.
The insurance industry is another large employer. Much of the insurance industry is 
involved in designing and selling insurance policies on people’s lives and property, but 
businesses are also major customers. So, if you work for an insurance company or a 
large insurance broker, you could find yourself arranging insurance on a Boeing 787 in 
the United States or an oil rig in Indonesia.
Life insurance companies are major lenders to corporations and to investors in commercial real estate. (Life insurance companies deploy the insurance premiums received 
from policyholders into medium- or long-term loans; banks specialize in shorter-term 
financing.) So you could end up negotiating a $50 million loan for construction of a 
new shopping center or investigating the creditworthiness of a family-owned manufacturing company that has applied for a loan to expand production.
Then there is the business of “managing money,” that is, deciding which companies’ shares to invest in or how to balance investment in shares with safer securities, 
such as the bonds (debt securities) issued by the U.S. Treasury. Take mutual funds, for 
example. A mutual fund collects money from individuals and invests in a portfolio of

Albert Rodriguez, European Markets Group, 
Major New York Bank
I joined the bank after majoring in finance. I spent the first 
6 months in the bank’s training program, rotating among 
departments. I was assigned to the European markets 
team just before the 2010 Greek crisis, when worries about 
a possible default caused interest rates on Greek government debt to jump to more than 4% above the rate on 
comparable German government debt. Those rates soon 
went much higher! There was a lot of activity, with everyone trying to figure out whether Greece might be forced 
to abandon the euro and how this would affect our business. My job is largely concerned with analyzing economies and assessing the prospects for bank business. 
There are plenty of opportunities to work abroad, and 
I hope to spend some time in Madrid or one of our other 
European offices.
Sherry Solera, Branch Manager, Regional Bank
I took basic finance courses in college, but nothing specific for banking. I started here as a teller. I was able to 
learn about banking through the bank’s training program 
and also by evening courses at a local college. Last year I 
was promoted to branch manager. I oversee the branch’s 
operations and help customers with a wide variety of problems. I’m also spending more time on credit analysis of 
business loan applications. I want to expand the branch’s 
business customers, but not by making loans to shaky 
companies.
Susan Webb, Research Analyst, Mutual Fund Group
After majoring in biochemistry, I joined the research department of a large mutual fund group. Because of my background, I was assigned to work with the senior pharmaceuticals 
analyst. I start the day by reading The Wall Street Journal and 
reviewing the analyses that come in each day from stockbroking firms. Sometimes we need to revise our earnings 
forecasts and meet with the portfolio managers to discuss 
possible trades. The remainder of my day is spent mainly in 
analyzing companies and developing forecasts of revenues 
and earnings. I meet frequently with pharmaceutical analysts 
in stockbroking firms, and we regularly visit company management. In the evenings I study for the Chartered Financial 
Analyst (CFA) exam. I did not study finance at college, so this 
is quite challenging. I hope eventually to move from a 
research role to become a portfolio manager.
Richard Gradley, Project Finance, Large Energy Company
After leaving college, I joined the finance department of a 
large energy company. I spent my first year helping to analyze capital investment proposals. I then moved to the project 
finance group, which is responsible for analyzing independent power projects around the world. Recently, I have been 
involved in a proposal to set up a company that would build 
and operate a large new electricity plant in southeast Asia. 
We built a spreadsheet model of the project to make sure that 
it was viable. We had to check that the contracts with the 
builders, operators, suppliers, and so on, were all in place 
before we could arrange bank financing for the project.

stocks or bonds. A financial analyst in a mutual fund analyzes the prospects for the 
securities and works with the investment manager to decide which should be bought 
and sold. Many other financial institutions also contain investment management 
departments. For example, you might work as a financial analyst in the investment 
department of an insurance company. (Insurance companies also invest in traded 
securities.) Or you could be a financial analyst in the trust department of a bank that 
manages money for retirement funds, universities, and charities.
Stockbroking firms help investment management companies and private individuals to invest in securities. They employ sales staff and dealers who make the trades. 
They also employ financial analysts to analyze the securities and help customers to 
decide which to buy or sell.
Investment banks and stockbroking firms are largely headquartered in New York, as 
are many of the large commercial banks. Insurance companies and investment management companies tend to be more scattered. For example, some of the largest insurance 
companies are headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut, and many investment management companies are located in Boston. Of course, some U.S. financial institutions have 
large businesses outside the United States. Finance is a global business. So you may 
spend some time working in a branch overseas or making the occasional trip to one of 
the other major financial centers, such as London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, or Singapore.

Chapter 1 Goals and Governance of the Corporation 23

are making a first acquaintance with financial management. Chapter 2 is an overview 
of financial markets and institutions. Chapter 3 reviews the basic concepts of accounting, and Chapter 4 demonstrates the techniques of financial statement analysis.
We have said that the financial manager’s task is to make investment and financing 
decisions that add value for the firm’s shareholders. But that statement opens up a 
treasure chest of follow-up questions that will occupy us from Chapter 4 onward:
∙ How do I calculate the value of a stream of future cash flows? A dollar that you 
receive today is worth more than the promise of a dollar in 10 or 20 years’ time. 
So, when measuring the effect of a new project on firm value, the financial manager 
needs to recognize the timing of the cash flows. In Chapters 5 through 10, we show 
how to calculate the present value of an investment that produces a stream of future 
cash flows. We begin by calculating the present value of bonds and stocks and then 
look at how to value the cash flows resulting from capital investment projects. Present 
value is a workhorse concept of corporate finance that shows up in almost every chapter.
∙ How do I measure risk? In Chapters 5 through 10, we largely ignore the issue of 
risk. But risky cash flows are less valuable than safe ones. In Chapters 11, 12, and 
13, we look at how to measure risk and how it affects present values.
∙ Where does financing come from? Broadly speaking, it comes from borrowing or from 
cash invested or reinvested by stockholders. But financing can get complicated when 
you get down to specifics. Chapter 14 gives an overview of the sources of finance. 
Chapters 15, 16, and 17 then look at how companies sell their securities to investors, 
the choice between debt and equity, and the decision to pay out cash to stockholders.
∙ How do I ensure that the firm’s financial decisions add up to a sensible whole?
There are two parts to this question. The first is concerned with making sure that the 
firm can finance its future growth strategy. This is the role of long-term planning. 
The second is concerned with ensuring that the firm has a sensible plan for managing 
and financing its short-term assets such as cash, inventories, and money due from 
customers. We cover long- and short-term planning in Chapters 18, 19, and 20.
∙ What about some of those other responsibilities of the financial manager that you 
mentioned earlier? Not all of the financial manager’s responsibilities can be 
classified simply as an investment decision or a financing decision. In Chapters 21 
through 24, we review four such topics. First we look at mergers and acquisitions. 
Then we consider international financial management. All the financial problems 
of doing business at home are present overseas, but the international financial 
manager faces the additional complications created by multiple currencies, 
different tax systems, and special regulations imposed by foreign institutions and 
governments. Finally, we look at risk management and the specialized securities, 
including futures and options, which managers can use to hedge or lay off risks.
That’s enough material to start, but as you reflect on this chapter, you can see 
certain themes emerging that you will encounter again and again throughout this book:
1. Corporate finance is about adding value.
2. The opportunity cost of capital sets the standard for investments.
3. A safe dollar is worth more than a risky one.
4. Smart investment decisions create more value than smart financing decisions.
5. Good governance matters.
1.9 Snippets of Financial History
Now let’s lighten up a little. In this book we are going to describe how financial 
decisions are made today. But financial markets also have an interesting history. Look 
at the nearby box, which lays out bits of this history, starting in prehistoric times, when 
the growth of bacteria anticipated the mathematics of compound interest, and continuing nearly to the present. We have keyed each of these episodes to the chapter of the 
book that discusses its topic.

undertaking of great advantage but nobody to know what it

was on his way out of the country. Readers nearly two centuries later could only wonder at the naïve or foolhardy 
investors in these ventures—that is, until they had a chance 
to participate in the follies unearthed by the financial crisis 
of 2008–2009. (Chapter 2)
1792 Formation of the New York Stock Exchange The New 
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was founded in 1792 when a 
group of brokers met under a buttonwood tree* and 
arranged to trade shares with one another at agreed rates 
of commission. Today the NYSE is the largest stock 
exchange in the world, trading on average about 1.5 billion 
shares a day. (Chapter 7)
1929 Stock Market Crashes Common stocks are risky investments. In September 1929 stock prices in the United 
States reached an all-time high, and the economist Irving 
Fisher forecast that they were at “a permanently high plateau.” Some 3 years later, stock prices were almost 90% 
lower, and it was to be a quarter of a century before the 
prices of September 1929 were seen again. Eighty years 
later, history came close to repeating itself. After stock 
prices peaked in July 2007, they slumped over the next 20 
months by 54%. (Chapter 11)
1960s Eurodollar Market In the 1950s the Soviet Union transferred its dollar holdings from the United States to a 
Russian-owned bank in Paris. This bank was best known 
by its telex address, eurobank, and consequently dollars 
held outside the United States came to be known as eurodollars. In the 1960s, U.S. taxes and regulation made it 
much cheaper to borrow and lend dollars in Europe than in 
the United States, and a huge market in eurodollars arose. 
(Chapter 14)
1971 Corporate Bankruptcies Every generation of investors 
is shocked and surprised by a major corporate bankruptcy. 
In 1971 the Penn Central Railroad, a pillar of American 
industry, suddenly collapsed. At that time, it was the largest corporate bankruptcy in history. In 2008, the investment bank Lehman Brothers smashed Penn Central’s 
record. (Chapter 16)
1972 Financial Futures Financial futures allow companies to 
protect themselves against fluctuations in interest rates, 
exchange rates, and so on. It is said that they originated 
from a remark by the economist Milton Friedman that 
he was unable to profit from his view that sterling (the U.K. 
currency) was overpriced. The Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange founded the first financial futures market. 
Today futures exchanges trade 6 billion contracts a year of 
financial futures. (Chapter 24)
1986 Capital Investment Decisions The largest investment 
project undertaken by a single private company was the 
construction of the tunnel under the English Channel. This 
started in 1986 and was completed in 1994 at a total cost 
of $15 billion. The cost of the Gorgon natural gas project in 
Australia is estimated at $54 billion. (Chapters 8, 9)
1988 Mergers The 1980s saw a wave of takeovers culminating in the $25 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco. Over a 
Date unknown Compound Growth Bacteria start to propagate by subdividing. They thereby demonstrate the power 
of compound growth. (Chapter 5)
c. 1800 b.c. Interest Rates In Babylonia, Hammurabi’s Code 
established maximum interest rates on loans. Borrowers 
often mortgaged their property and sometimes their 
spouses, but lenders were obliged to return spouses in 
good condition within 3 years. (Chapter 6)
c. 1000 b.c. Options One of the earliest recorded options is 
described by Aristotle. The philosopher Thales knew by 
the stars that there would be a great olive harvest, so, having a little money, he bought options for the use of olive 
presses. When the harvest came, Thales was able to rent 
the presses at great profit. Today financial managers need 
to be able to evaluate options to buy or sell a wide variety 
of assets. (Chapter 23)
15th century International Banking Modern international 
banking had its origins in the great Florentine banking 
houses. But the entire European network of the Medici 
empire employed only 57 people in eight offices. Today 
the London-based bank HSBC has around 260,000 
employees in 71 different countries. (Chapter 14)
1650 Futures Futures markets allow companies to protect 
themselves against fluctuations in commodity prices. 
During the Tokugawa era in Japan, feudal lords collected 
rents in the form of rice, but often they wished to trade 
their future rice deliveries. Rice futures therefore came to 
be traded on what was later known as the Dojima Rice 
Market. Rice futures are still traded, but now companies 
can also trade in futures on a range of items from pork bellies to stock market indexes. (Chapter 24)
17th century Joint Stock Corporations Although investors 
have for a long time combined together as joint owners 
of an enterprise, the modern corporation with a large number of stockholders originated with the formation in England 
of trading firms like the East India Company (est. 1599). 
(Chapter 15)
17th century Money America has been in the forefront in the 
development of new types of money. Early settlers often 
used a shell known as wampum. For example, Peter 
Stuyvesant raised a loan in wampum, and in Massachusetts it was legal tender. Unfortunately, the enterprising 
settlers found that with a little dye the relatively common 
white wampum shells could be converted profitably into 
the more valuable black ones, which confirmed Gresham’s 
law that bad money drives out good. The first issue of 
paper money in America was by the Massachusetts Bay 
Colony in 1690, and other colonies soon set their printing 
presses to producing money. In 1862 Congress agreed to 
an issue of paper money that would be legal tender. These 
notes, printed in green ink, immediately became known as 
“greenbacks.” (Chapters 19, 20)
1720 New-Issue Speculation From time to time investors 
have been tempted by speculative new issues. During 
the South Sea Bubble in England, one company was 
launched to develop perpetual motion. Another enterprising individual announced a company “for carrying on an

eight other countries. This is not the first time that different 
countries have agreed on a common currency. In 1865 
France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy came together in 
the Latin Monetary Union, and they were joined by Greece 
and Romania the following year. Members of the European 
Monetary Union (EMU) hope that the euro will be a longerlasting success than this earlier experiment. As we write 
this in early 2016, the euro appears to have weathered 
the worst of the crisis caused by the Greek government’s 
debt default. (Chapter 23)
2002 Financial Scandals A seemingly endless series of 
financial and accounting scandals climaxed in this year. 
Resulting bankruptcies included the icons Enron (and its 
accounting firm, Arthur Andersen), WorldCom, and the 
Italian food company Parmalat. Congress passed the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act to increase the accountability of corporations and executives. (Chapters 1, 14)
2007–2009 Subprime Mortgages Subprime mortgages are 
housing loans made to homeowners with shaky credit 
standing. After a decade in which housing prices had consistently gone up, lenders became complacent about the 
risks of these home loans and progressively loosened 
lending standards. When housing prices stalled and interest rates increased in 2007, many of these loans went bad. 
Some large banks such as Lehman Brothers went to the 
wall, while others such as Wachovia and Merrill Lynch 
were rescued with the aid of government money. 
(Chapters 2, 14)
2011 Defaults on Sovereign Debt By 2010 the Greek government had amassed a huge $460 billion of debt. Other 
eurozone governments and the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) rushed to Greece’s aid, but their assistance 
was insufficient, and in 2011 the Greek government 
defaulted on $100 billion of debt. It was the largest-ever 
sovereign default. Investors nervously eyed other highly 
indebted eurozone countries. (Chapter 2)

period of 6 weeks, three groups battled for control of the 
company. As one of the contestants put it, “We were 
charging through the rice paddies, not stopping for 
anything and taking no prisoners.” The takeover was the 
largest in history and generated almost $1 billion in fees 
for the banks and advisers. (Chapter 21)
1993 Inflation Financial managers need to recognize the 
effect of inflation on interest rates and on the profitability 
of the firm’s investments. In the United States inflation has 
been relatively modest, but some countries have suffered 
from hyperinflation. In Hungary after World War II, the government issued banknotes worth 1,000 trillion pengoes. In 
Yugoslavia in October 1993, prices rose by nearly 2,000% 
and a dollar bought 105 million dinars. The inflation rate in 
Venezuela in late 2015 was about 180%. (Chapter 5)
1780 and 1997 Inflation-Indexed Debt In 1780, Massachusetts paid Revolutionary War soldiers with interest-bearing 
notes rather than its rapidly eroding currency. Interest and 
principal payments on the notes were tied to the subsequent rate of inflation. After a 217-year hiatus, the U.S. 
Treasury issued inflation-indexed notes called TIPS 
(Treasury Inflation Protected Securities). Many other countries, including Britain and Israel, had done so previously. 
(Chapter 6)
1993 Controlling Risk When a company fails to keep close 
tabs on the risks being taken by its employees, it can get 
into serious trouble. This was the fate of Barings, a 
220-year-old British bank that numbered the queen among 
its clients. In 1993 it discovered that Nick Leeson, a trader 
in its Singapore office, had hidden losses of $1.3 billion 
(£869 million) from unauthorized bets on the Japanese 
equity market. The losses wiped out Barings and landed 
Leeson in jail, with a 6-year sentence. In 2008 a rogue 
trader at Morgan Stanley established a new record by losing $9 billion on unauthorized deals. (Chapter 24)
1999 The Euro Large corporations do business in many 
currencies. In 1999 a new currency came into existence 
when 11 European countries adopted the euro in place of 
their separate currencies. They have since been joined by

SUMMARY
Financial management can be broken down into (1) the investment or capital budgeting 
decision and (2) the financing decision. The firm has to decide (1) which real assets to 
invest in and (2) how to raise the funds necessary to pay for those investments.
Real assets include all assets used in the production or sale of the firms’ products or 
services. They can be tangible (plant and equipment, for example) or intangible (patents 
or trademarks, for example). In contrast, financial assets (such as stocks or bonds) are 
claims on the income generated by real assets.
Corporations are distinct, permanent legal entities. They allow for separation of ownership and control, and they can continue operating without disruption even as management 
or ownership changes. They provide limited liability to their owners. On the other hand,

decisions made by financial

26 Part One Introduction
managing the corporation’s legal machinery is costly. Also, corporations are subject to 
double taxation, because they pay taxes on their profits and the shareholders are taxed 
again when they receive dividends or sell their shares at a profit.
Almost all managers are involved to some degree in investment decisions, but some managers specialize in finance, for example, the treasurer, controller, and CFO. The treasurer
is most directly responsible for raising capital and maintaining relationships with banks 
and investors that hold the firm’s securities. The controller is responsible for preparing 
financial statements and managing budgets. In large firms, a chief financial officer
oversees both the treasurer and the controller and is involved in financial policymaking and 
corporate planning.
Value maximization is the natural financial goal of the firm. Shareholders can invest 
or consume the increased wealth as they wish, provided that they have access to 
well-functioning financial markets.
Companies either can invest in real assets or can return the cash to shareholders, who can 
invest it for themselves. The return that shareholders can earn for themselves is called the 
opportunity cost of capital. Companies create value for shareholders whenever they can 
earn a higher return on their investments than the opportunity cost of capital.
Conflicts of interest between managers and stockholders can lead to agency problems
and agency costs. Agency problems are kept in check by financial controls, by welldesigned compensation packages for managers, and by effective corporate governance.
Shareholders do not want the maximum possible stock price; they want the maximum 
honest price. But there need be no conflict between value maximization and ethical behavior. The surest route to maximum value starts with products and services that satisfy 
customers. A good reputation with customers, employees, and other stakeholders is 
important for the firm’s long-run profitability and value.
