irm can carry the losses back, 
deduct them from taxable income in earlier years, and claim a refund of past taxes. 
Losses can also be carried forward and deducted from taxable income in the future.14
Personal Tax
Table 3.7 shows the U.S. rates of personal tax. Notice that as income increases, the 
tax rate also increases. Notice also that the top personal tax rate is higher than the top 
corporate rate.
The tax rates presented in Table 3.7 are marginal tax rates. The marginal tax rate 
is the tax that the individual pays on each extra dollar of income. For example, as a 
single taxpayer, you would pay 10 cents of tax on each extra dollar you earn when your 
income is below $9,275, but once income exceeds $9,275, you would pay 15 cents of 
tax on each extra dollar of income up to an income of $37,650. If your total income is 
$50,000, your tax bill is 10% of the first $9,275 of income, 15% of the next $28,375 
(i.e., 37,650 − 9,275), and 25% of the remaining $12,350:
Tax = (.10 × $9,275) + (.15 × $28,375) + (.25 × $12,350) = $8,271.25

Additional taxes owed per 
dollar of additional income.
Recalculate the figures in Table 3.6, assuming that firm A now has to make interest payments of $60 million. What happens to taxes paid? Does net income fall 
by the additional $20 million interest payment compared with the case considered in Table 3.6, where interest expense was only $40 million?

The average tax rate is simply the total tax bill divided by total income. In this 
example it is $8,271.25/$50,000 = .165, or 16.5%. Notice that the average rate is lower 
than the marginal rate. This is because of the lower rates on the first $37,650.

Average and 
marginal tax rates
The tax rates in Table 3.7 apply to “ordinary income,” primarily income earned as 
salary or wages. Interest earnings also are treated as ordinary income.
The U.S. government also taxes investment earnings, for example dividends or 
capital gains. The treatment of dividend income in the United States leads to what is 
commonly dubbed the “double taxation” of corporate earnings. Each dollar the company earns is taxed at the corporate rate. Then, if the company pays a dividend out of 
this after-tax income, the shareholder pays personal income taxes on the distribution. 
The original earnings are taxed first as corporate income and again as dividend income. 
Suppose instead that the company earns a dollar which is paid out as interest. The dollar escapes corporate tax because the interest payment is considered a business expense 
that reduces the firm’s taxable income.
Capital gains are also taxed, but only when the gains are realized. Suppose that you 
bought Bio-technics stock when it was selling for 10 cents a share. Its market price 
today is $1 a share. As long as you hold on to your stock, there is no tax to pay on your 
gain. But if you sell, the 90 cents of capital gain is taxed. 
Table 3.8 shows tax rates on investment income. For most investors, the effective 
tax rate is either 15% or 18.8% (15% plus a potential 3.8% surcharge), but the highest 
income investors pay an effective rate of 23.8%.
Financial managers need to worry about the tax treatment of investment income 
because tax policy will affect the prices individuals are willing to pay for the company’s stock or bonds. We will return to these issues in Part 5 of the text.
The tax rates in Table 3.7 and Table 3.8 apply to individuals. But financial institutions are major investors in corporate securities. These institutions often have special 
tax provisions. For example, pension funds are not taxed on interest or dividend 
income or on capital gains.
*These rates apply to capital gains and dividends on assets held for at least one year.
**In addition to these nominal rates, an additional 3.8% surtax is assessed on net investment income for taxpayers 
with total income over $200,000 (single filers) or $250,000 (married filing jointly).

income of $80,000? What are the avera
