Like mutual funds, hedge funds also pool the savings of different investors and 
invest on their behalf. But they differ from mutual funds in at least two ways. First, 
because hedge funds usually follow complex, high-risk investment strategies, access is 
usually restricted to knowledgeable investors such as pension funds, endowment funds, 
and wealthy individuals. Don’t try to send a check for $3,000 or $5,000 to a hedge 
fund; most hedge funds are not in the “retail” investment business. Second, hedge 
funds try to attract the most talented managers by compensating them with potentially 
lucrative, performance-related fees.4
 In contrast, mutual funds usually charge a fixed 
percentage of assets under management.
Hedge funds follow many different investment strategies. Some try to make a profit 
by identifying overvalued stocks or markets and selling short. (We will not go into 
procedures for short-selling here. Just remember that short-sellers profit when prices 
fall.5
) “Vulture funds” specialize in the securities of distressed corporations. Some 
hedge funds take bets on firms involved in merger negotiations, others look for mispriced convertible bonds, and some take positions in currencies and interest rates. 
Hedge funds manage less money than mutual funds, but they sometimes take very big 
positions and have a large impact on the market.
There are other ways of pooling and investing savings. Consider a pension plan set 
up by a corporation or other organization on behalf of its employees. There are several 
types of pension plan. The most common type of plan is the defined-contribution plan. 
In this case, a percentage of the employee’s monthly paycheck is contributed to a 
pension fund. (The employer and employee may each contribute 5%, for example.) 
Contributions from all participating employees are pooled and invested in securities or 
mutual funds. (Usually the employees can choose from a menu of funds with different 
investment strategies.) Each employee’s balance in the plan grows over the years as 
contributions continue and investment income accumulates. The balance in the plan 
can be used to finance living expenses after retirement. The amount available for 
retirement depends on the accumulated contributions and on the rate of return earned 
on the investments.6
Pension funds are designed for long-run investment. They provide professional 
management and diversification. They also have an important tax advantage: Contributions are tax-deductible, and investment returns inside the plan are not taxed until 
cash is finally withdrawn.7
Pension plans are among the most important vehicles for savings. Total assets held 
by U.S. pension plans were about $15 trillion in 2015.

 Sometimes these fees can be very large indeed. For example, Forbes estimated that the top hedge fund manager in 2012 earned $2.2 billion in fees.
5
 A short-seller borrows a security from another investor and sells it. Of course, the seller must sooner or later 
buy the security back and return it to its original owner. The short-seller earns a profit if the security can be 
bought back at a lower price than it was sold for.
6
 In a defined-benefit plan, the employer promises a certain level of retirement benefits (set by a formula) and 
the employer invests in the pension plan. The plan’s accumulated investment value has to be large enough to 
cover the promised benefits. If not, the employer must put in more money. Defined-benefit plans are gradually 
giving way to defined-contribution plans.
7
 Defined-benefit pension plans share these same advantages, except that the employer invests rather than the 
employees. In a defined-benefit plan, the advantage of tax deferral on investment income accrues to the 
employer. This deferral reduces the cost of funding the plan.
Individual investors can buy bonds and stocks directly, or they can put their 
money in a mutual fund or a defined-contribution pension fund. What are the 
advantages of the second strategy?

Financial Institutions
Banks and insurance companies are financial institutions.8
 A financial institution is 
an intermediary that does more than just pool and invest savings. Institutions raise 
financing in special ways, for example, by accepting deposits or selling insurance policies, and they provide additional financial services. Unlike a mutual fund, they not 
only invest in securities but also lend money directly to individuals, businesses, or 
other organizations.
Commercial Banks There are about 5,400 commercial banks in the United States.9
They vary from giants such as JPMorgan Chase with $2.6 trillion of assets to relative 
dwarfs like Cambridge Bancorp with assets of $1.7 billion.
Commercial banks are major sources of loans for corporations. (In the United 
States, they are generally not allowed to make equity investments in corporations, 
although banks in most other countries can do so.) Suppose that a local forest 
products company negotiates a 9-month bank loan for $2.5 million. The flow of 
savings is:

 We may be drawing too fine a distinction between financial intermediaries and institutions. A mutual fund 
could be considered a financial institution. But “financial institution” usually suggests a more complicated intermediary, such as a bank.
9
 Banks that accept deposits and provide financing mostly to businesses are called commercial banks. Savings 
banks and savings & loans (S&Ls) accept deposits and lend mostly to individuals, for example, as mortgage 
loans to home buyers.
10 Investment banks do not take deposits and do not lend money to businesses or individuals, except as bridge 
loans made as temporary financing for takeovers or other transactions. Investment banks are sometimes called 
merchant banks.

The bank provides debt financing for the company and, at the same time, provides 
a place for depositors to park their money safely and withdraw it as needed.
Investment Banks We have discussed commercial banks, which raise money from 
depositors and other investors and then make loans to businesses and individuals. 
Investment banks are different. Investment banks do not generally take deposits or 
make loans to companies.10 Instead, they advise and assist companies in obtaining 
finance. For example, investment banks underwrite stock offerings by purchasing the 
new shares from the issuing company at a negotiated price and reselling the shares to 
investors. Thus the issuing company gets a fixed price for the new shares, and the 
investment bank takes responsibility for distributing the shares to investors. We discuss share issues in more detail in Chapter 15.
Investment banks also advise on takeovers, mergers, and acquisitions.
