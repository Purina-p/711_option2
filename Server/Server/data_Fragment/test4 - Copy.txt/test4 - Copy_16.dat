ust one policy but thousands. Normally the incidence 
of fires “averages out,” leaving the company with a predictable obligation to its policyholders as a group. Of course, the insurance company must charge enough for its policies to cover selling and administrative costs, pay policyholders’ claims, and generate 
a profit for its stockholders.
Total Financing of U.S. Corporations
The pie chart in Figure 2.3 shows the investors in bonds and other debt securities. 
Notice the importance of institutional investors—mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and banks. Households (individual investors) hold less than 5% of the 
debt pie. The other slices represent the rest of the world (investors from outside the 
United States) and other, smaller categories of investors.

Functions of Financial Markets 
and Intermediaries
Financial markets and intermediaries provide financing for business. They channel 
savings to real investment. That much should be loud and clear from Sections 2.1 and 
2.2 of this chapter. But there are other functions that may not be quite so obvious.

Transporting Cash across Time
Individuals need to transport expenditures in time. If you have money now that you 
wish to save for a rainy day, you can (for example) put the money in a savings account 
at a bank and withdraw it with interest later. If you don’t have money today, say to buy 
a car, you can borrow money from the bank and pay off the loan later. Modern finance 
provides a kind of time machine. Lenders transport money forward in time; borrowers 
transport it back. Both are happier than if they were forced to spend income as it 
arrives. Of course, individuals are not alone in needing to raise cash from time to time. 
Firms with good investment opportunities, but a shortage of internally generated cash, 
raise cash by borrowing or selling new shares. Many governments run deficits and 
finance current outlays by issuing debt.
Young people saving for retirement may transport their current earnings 30 or 40 
years into the future by means of a pension fund. They can even transport income to 
their heirs by purchase of a life insurance policy.
In principle, individuals or firms with cash surpluses could take out newspaper 
advertisements or surf the web looking for counterparties with cash shortages. But it is 
usually cheaper and more convenient to use financial markets and intermediaries. It is 
not just a matter of avoiding the cost of searching for the right counterparty. Follow-up 
is needed. For example, banks don’t just lend money and walk away. They monitor the 
borrower to make sure that the loan is used for its intended purpose and that the borrower’s credit stays solid.
Risk Transfer and Diversification
Financial markets and intermediaries allow investors and businesses to reduce 
and reallocate risk. Insurance companies are an obvious example. When you buy 
homeowner’s insurance, you greatly reduce the risk of loss from fire, theft, or accidents. But your policy is not a very risky bet for the insurance company. It diversifies 
by issuing thousands of policies, and it expects losses to average out over the policies.13
The insurance company allows you to pool risk with thousands of other homeowners.
Investors should diversify too. For example, you can buy shares in a mutual fund 
that holds hundreds of stocks. In fact, you can buy index funds that invest in all the 
stocks in the popular market indexes. For example, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund holds 
the stocks in the Standard & Poor’s Composite stock market index. (The “S&P 500” 
tracks the performance of the largest U.S. stocks. It is the index most used by professional investors.) If you buy this fund, you are insulated from the company-specific 
risks of the 500 companies in the index. These risks are averaged out by diversification. Of course you are still left with the risk that the level of the stock market as a 
whole will fall. In fact, we will see in Chapter 11 that investors are mostly concerned 
with market risk, not the specific risks of individual companies.
Index mutual funds are one way to invest in widely diversified portfolios at low 
cost. Another route is provided by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are portfolios 
of stocks that can be bought or sold in a single trade. For example, Standard & Poor’s 
Depositary Receipts (SPDRs, or “spiders”) invest in portfolios that match Standard & 
Poor’s stock market indexes. The total amount invested in the spider that tracks the 
benchmark S&P 500 index was $134 billion in early 2016.
ETFs are in some ways more efficient than mutual funds. To buy or sell an ETF, 
you simply make a trade, just as if you bought or sold shares of stock.14  This is 
13 Unfortunately for insurance companies, the losses don’t always average out. Hurricanes and earthquakes can 
damage thousands of homes at once. The potential losses are so great that property insurance companies buy 
reinsurance against such catastrophes.
14 ETFs are in this respect like closed-end mutual funds (see footnote 3). But ETFs do not have managers with 
the discretion to try to “pick winners.” ETF portfolios are tied down to indexes or fixed baskets of securities. 
ETF issuers make sure that the ETF price tracks the price of the underlying index or basket.

different from investing in an open-end mutual fund. In that case you have to send 
money to the fund in exchange for newly issued shares. And, if you want to withdraw 
the investment, you have to notify the fund, which redeems your shares and sends you 
a check. Also, many of the larger ETFs charge lower fees than mutual funds. State 
Street Global Advisors charges just .11% a year for managing the Standard & Poor’s 
500 Index Spider. For a $100,000 investment, the fee is only .0011 × 100,000 = $110.
Financial markets provide other mechanisms for sharing risks. For example, a 
wheat farmer and a baking company are each exposed to fluctuations in the price of 
wheat after the harvest. The farmer worries about low prices, the baker about high 
prices. They can both rest easier if the baker can agree with the farmer to buy wheat in 
the future at a fixed price. Of course, it would be difficult, to say the least, if the baker 
and the farmer had to contact an Internet dating service to get together to make a deal. 
Fortunately, no dating service is needed: Each can trade in commodity markets, the 
farmer as a seller and the baker as a buyer.
Liquidity
Markets and intermediaries also provide liquidity, that is, the ability to turn an investment back into cash when needed. Suppose you deposit $5,000 in a savings bank on 
February 1. During that month, the bank uses your deposit and other new deposits to 
make a 6-month construction loan to a real estate developer. On March 1, you realize 
that you need your $5,000 back. The bank can give it to you. Because the bank has 
thousands of depositors, and other sources of financing if necessary, it can make an 
illiquid loan to the developer financed by liquid deposits made by you and other customers. If you lend your money for 6 months directly to the real estate developer, you 
will have a hard time retrieving it 1 month later.15
The shares of public companies are liquid because they are traded more or less continuously in the stock market. An Italian investor who puts $60,000 into Bank of 
America shares can recover that money on short notice. (A $60,000 sell order is a drop 
in the bucket compared with the normal trading volume of Bank of America shares.) 
Mutual funds can redeem their shares for cash on short notice because the funds invest 
in traded securities, which can be sold as necessary.
Of course, liquidity is a matter of degree. Foreign exchange markets for major currencies are exceptionally liquid. Bank of America or Deutsche Bank could buy $200 million 
worth of yen or euros in the blink of an eye, with hardly any effect on foreign exchange 
rates. U.S. Treasury securities are also very liquid, and the shares of the largest companies on the major international stock exchanges are only slightly less so.
Liquidity is most important when you’re in a hurry. If you try to sell $500,000 
worth of the shares of a small, thinly traded company all at once, you will probably 
knock down the price to some extent. If you’re patient and don’t surprise other investors with a large, sudden sell order, you may be able to unload your shares on better 
terms. It’s the same problem that you may face in selling real estate. A house or condominium is not a liquid asset in a panic sale. If you’re determined to sell in an afternoon, you’re not going to get full value.
The Payment Mechanism
Think how inconvenient life would be if you had to pay for every purchase in cash or 
if Boeing had to ship truckloads of hundred-dollar bills around the country to pay its 
suppliers. Checking accounts, credit cards, and electronic transfers allow individuals 
liquidity
The ability to sell an asset 
on short notice at close to 
the market value.
15 Of course, the bank can’t repay all depositors simultaneously. To do so, it would have to sell off its loans to 
the real estate developer and other borrowers. These loans are not liquid. This raises the specter of bank runs, 
where doubts about a bank’s ability to pay off its depositors cause a rush of withdrawals, with each depositor 
trying to get his or her money out first. Bank runs are rare because bank deposits are backed up by the U.S. 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures bank accounts up to $250,000 per account.

and firms to send and receive payments quickly and safely over long distances. Banks 
are the obvious providers of payment services, but they are not alone. For example, if 
you buy shares in a money market mutual fund, your money is pooled with that of 
other investors and used to buy safe, short-term securities. You can then write checks 
on this mutual fund investment, just as if you had a bank deposit.
Information Provided by Financial Markets
In well-functioning financial markets, you can see what securities and commodities are 
worth, and you can see—or at least estimate—the rates of return that investors can expect 
on their savings. The information provided by financial markets is often essential to a 
financial manager’s job. Here are three examples of how this information can be used.
Commodity Prices Catalytic converters are used in the exhaust systems of cars and 
light trucks to reduce pollution. The catalysts include platinum, which is traded on the 
New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
In March a manufacturer of catalytic converters is planning production for October. 
How much per ounce should the company budget for purchases of platinum in that 
month? Easy: The company’s CFO looks up the futures price of platinum on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange—$972 per ounce for delivery in October (this was the 
closing price for platinum in March 2016, for delivery in October). The CFO can lock 
in that price if she wishes. The details of such a trade are covered in Chapter 24.
Interest Rates The CFO of Catalytic Concepts has to raise $400 million in new 
financing. She considers an issue of long-term bonds. What will the interest rate on the 
bonds be? To find out, the CFO looks up interest rates on existing bonds traded in 
financial markets.
The results are shown in Table 2.2. Notice how the interest rate climbs as credit 
quality deteriorates: The largest, safest companies, which are rated AAA (“triple-A”), 
can raise long-term debt at a 2.59% interest rate. The interest rates for AA, A, and 
BBB rise to 2.62%, 3.03%, and 4.32%, respectively. BBB companies are still regarded 
as investment grade, that is, good quality, but the next step down takes the investor into 
junk bond territory. The interest rate for BB debt climbs to 5.62%. Single-B companies 
are riskier still, so investors demand 8.32%.
There will be more on bond ratings and interest rates in Chapter 6. But you can see 
how a financial manager can use information from fixed-income markets to forecast 
the interest rate on new debt financing. For example, if Catalytic Concepts can qualify 
as a BBB-rated company, and interest rates are as shown in Table 2.2, it should be able 
to raise new debt financing for approximately 4.32%.
Company Values How much was Callaway Golf worth in March 2016? How about 
Alaska Air Group, Entergy, Yum! Brands, or GE? Table 2.3 shows the market capitalization of each company. We simply multiply the number of shares outstanding by the 
price per share in the stock market. Investors valued Callaway Golf at $821 million 
and GE at $283 billion.

Stock prices and company values summarize investors’ collective assessment 
of how well a company is doing, both its current performance and its future prospects. Thus an increase in stock price sends a positive signal from investors to 
managers.16 That is why top management’s compensation is linked to stock prices. A 
manager who owns shares in his or her company will be motivated to increase the 
company’s market value. This reduces agency costs by aligning the interests of managers and stockholders.
This is one important advantage of going public. A private company can’t use its 
stock price as a measure of performance. It can still compensate managers with shares, 
but the shares will not be valued in a financial market.
Cost of Capital Financial managers look to financial markets to measure, or at 
least estimate, the cost of capital for the firm’s investment projects. The cost of capital 
is the minimum acceptable rate of return on the project. Investment projects offering 
rates of return higher than their cost of capital are worthwhile because they add value; 
they make both the firm and its shareholders better off financially. Projects offering 
rates of return less than the cost of capital subtract value and should not be 
undertaken.17
Thus the hurdle rate for investments inside the corporation is actually set outside 
the corporation. The expected rate of return on investments in financial markets determines the opportunity cost of capital.
The opportunity cost of capital is generally not the interest rate that the firm pays on 
a loan from a bank or insurance company. If the company is making a risky investment, the opportunity cost of capital is the expected rate of return that investors can 
achieve in financial markets at the same level of risk. The expected rate of return on 
risky securities is normally well above the interest rate on corporate borrowing.
We introduced the cost of capital in Chapter 1, but this brief reminder may help to 
fix the idea. We cover the cost of capital in detail in Chapters 11 and 12.

16 We can’t claim that investors’ assessments of value are always correct. Finance can be a risky and dangerous 
business—dangerous for your wealth, that is. With hindsight we see horrible mistakes by investors, for example, 
the gross overvaluation of Internet and telecom companies in 2000. On average, however, it appears that financial markets collect and assess information quickly and accurately. We’ll discuss this issue again in Chapter 7.
17 Of course, the firm may invest for other reasons. For example, it may invest in pollution control equipment for 
a factory. The equipment may not generate a cash return but may still be worth investing in to meet legal and 
ethical obligations.

Chapter 2 Financial Markets and Institutions 49
bre22619_ch02_032-055.indd 49 10/06/16 03:41 PM
The Crisis of 2007–2009
The financial crisis of 2007–2009 raised many questions, but it settled one question 
conclusively: Yes, financial markets and institutions are important. When financial 
markets and institutions ceased to operate properly, the world was pushed into a global 
recession.
The financial crisis had its roots in the easy-money policies that were pursued by 
the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks following the collapse of the Internet 
and telecom stock bubble in 2000. At the same time, large balance-of-payments surpluses in Asian economies were invested back into U.S. debt securities. This also 
helped to push down interest rates and contribute to lax credit.
Banks took advantage of this cheap money to expand the supply of subprime mortgages to low-income borrowers. Many banks tempted would-be homeowners with low 
initial payments, offset by significantly higher payments later.18 (Some home buyers 
were betting on escalating housing prices so that they could resell or refinance before 
the higher payments kicked in.) One lender is even said to have advertised what it 
dubbed its “NINJA” loan—NINJA standing for “No Income, No Job, and No Assets.” 
Most subprime mortgages were then packaged together into mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) that could be resold. But, instead of selling these securities to investors 
who could best bear the risk, many banks kept large quantities of the loans on their 
own books or sold them to other banks.
The widespread availability of mortgage finance fueled a dramatic increase in 
house prices, which doubled in the 5 years ending June 2006. At that point, prices 
started to slide and homeowners began to default on their mortgages. A year later, 
Bear Stearns, a large investment bank, announced huge losses on the mortgage investments that were held in two of its hedge funds. By the spring of 2008, Bear Stearns 
was on the verge of bankruptcy, and the U.S. Federal Reserve arranged for it to be 
acquired by JPMorgan Chase.
The crisis peaked in September 2008, when the U.S. government was obliged to take 
over the giant federal mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which 
had invested several hundred billion dollars in subprime mortgage-backed securities. 
Over the next few days, the financial system started to melt down. Both Merrill Lynch 
and Lehman Brothers were in danger of failing. On September 14, the government 
arranged for Bank of America to take over Merrill in return for financial guarantees. 
However, it did nothing to rescue Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy protection the next day. Two days later, the government reluctantly lent $85 billion to the 
giant insurance company AIG, which had insured huge volumes of mortgage-backed 
securities and other bonds against default. The following day, the Treasury unveiled its 
first proposal to spend $700 billion to purchase “toxic” mortgage-backed securities.
After the failure of Lehman and the forced rescues of Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie 
Mac, Merrill Lynch, and AIG, investors and financial institutions had to ask, “Who will 
be next? Do I dare trade with or lend money to Bank X?” In many situations, the cautious 
answer was “No.” Customary day-to-day financial transactions were canceled or completed on onerous terms.19 At the same time, trading in MBSs and other hard-to-value 
securities dried up; it therefore became even harder to know what these securities were 
worth. As banks and other financial institutions became reluctant to trade securities or 
lend to one another, the supply of credit to the economy contracted and business investment was cut back. The U.S. economy suffered one of its worst setbacks since the Great 
Depression. Unemployment rose rapidly and business bankruptcies tripled.
2.4
18 With a so-called option ARM loan, the minimum mortgage payment was often not even sufficient to cover 
that month’s interest on the loan. The unpaid interest was then added to the amount of the mortgage, so the 
homeowner was burdened by an ever-increasing mortgage that one day would need to be paid off.
19  The interest rate on interbank loans rose in 2008 to 4.6% above the rate on U.S. Treasury debt. The normal 
spread over Treasuries is less than .5%.

bre22619_ch02_032-055.indd 50 10/24/16 03:38 PM
Few developed economies escaped the crisis. As well as suffering from a collapse in 
their own housing markets, a number of foreign banks had made large investments in 
U.S. subprime mortgages and had to be rescued by their governments. Many European 
governments were already heavily in debt and, as the cost of the bank bailouts mounted, 
investors began to worry about the ability of the governments to repay their debts. 
Thus in Europe, the banking crisis became entwined with a sovereign debt crisis.
The invention of MBSs also made mortgages liquid. They 
are actively traded among banks, insurance companies, 
mutual funds, pension funds, and endowments.
The MBS market has grown explosively. With the growth 
came more and more complexity. Issuers were not content 
with the simple pass-through MBS described earlier. They 
issued complicated packages of securities called tranches.
The most senior tranches were given first call on all cash 
flows from the mortgage portfolio and were viewed as almost 
risk-free. Bond-rating agencies gave their highest, triple-A ratings to the senior tranches, even for MBSs based on subprime mortgages for homeowners with weak credit. Many 
investors in triple-A tranches lost a lot of money in the crisis of 
2007–2009. We discuss bond ratings in Chapter 6.
The MBS market survived. It is still by far the largest source 
of mortgage financing. By 2015, the aggregate MBSs outstanding exceeded $2 trillion. MBSs are part of a broader 
market for asset-backed securities, which include securities 
that work like MBSs but are based on portfolios of other types 
of assets, including car loans, bank loans to businesses, and 
financing for commercial real estate.
Mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) provide another example of how financial markets convey savings to finance 
investment in real assets. In this case, the real assets 
are homes, which homeowners finance in part with mortgage loans.
In the old days—the 1960s, for example—most mortgage 
loans were made by local banks, savings banks, and savings 
and loan institutions (S&Ls), which accepted deposits and savings accounts and made mortgage and other local loans. We 
will use an S&L as the example. The flow of savings would be 
as described by the figure in Panel a, at the bottom of this box.
The typical mortgage was long term, up to 30 years maturity, with a fixed interest rate. The S&Ls’ liabilities—chiefly savings accounts—had much shorter maturities, perhaps a year 
or two on average. The S&Ls were therefore “borrowing 
short, lending long,” a dangerous investment strategy. When 
interest rates rose in the 1970s and 1980s, the S&Ls’ interest 
costs on savings accounts rose, too, but their interest income 
was locked up in long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. Losses 
mounted. The S&L crisis of the 1980s followed.*
The invention of the MBS allowed S&Ls to eliminate the risks 
of borrowing short and lending long. You can still get a mortgage 
from your local S&L, but now the S&L does not have to keep it. 
The S&L originates the mortgage, but will probably resell it to an 
MBS issuer—for example, Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association or FNMA†) or Bank of America. The issuer combines your mortgage with hundreds or thousands of others and 
issues an MBS backed by the combined portfolio. The MBS is 
sold to investors such as life insurance companies that want to 
hold long-term, fixed-rate obligations. Cash flows from the mortgage portfolio are passed through to investors.‡
Suppose a life insurance company purchases an MBS. The 
flow of savings would now match the figure in Panel b.
Finance in Practice Mortgage-Backed Securities
*For a history of the crisis, see Edward J. Kane, The S&L Insurance Mess: How 
Did It Happen? (Washington, D.C.: Urban Institute Press, 1989).
†Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) are 
government-sponsored entities (GSEs) charged with increasing the availability 
of mortgage credit. The GSEs purchase “conforming loans” and package and 
resell them as MBSs. Nonconforming loans—for example, large, “jumbo” 
mortgages—are packaged by banks such as Citigroup or Bank of America.
‡ You still send monthly payments to your local S&L. The S&L extracts a small 
servicing fee and sends your payments along to the MBS issuer, which also 
extracts a small servicing fee. Net cash flows from the portfolio of mortgages
