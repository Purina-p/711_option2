depreciation on fixed assets is $17,633 million. So while the assets cost $40,353 
million, their net value in the accounts is only $40,353 − $17,633 = $22,720 million.
In addition to its tangible assets, Home Depot also has valuable intangible assets, 
such as its brand name, skilled management, and a well-trained labor force. Accountants are generally reluctant to record these intangible assets in the balance sheet unless 
they can be readily identified and valued.
There is, however, one important exception. When Home Depot has acquired other 
businesses in the past, it has paid more for their assets than the value shown in the 
firms’ accounts. This difference is shown in Home Depot’s balance sheet as “goodwill.” 
Most of the intangible assets on Home Depot’s balance sheet consist of goodwill.
Now look at the right-hand portion of Home Depot’s balance sheet, which shows 
where the money to buy its assets came from. The accountant starts by looking at the 
company’s liabilities—that is, the money owed by the company. First come those liabilities that are likely to be paid off most rapidly. For example, Home Depot has borrowed 
$328 million, due to be repaid shortly. It also owes its suppliers $9,473 million for goods 
that have been delivered but not yet paid for. These unpaid bills are shown as accounts 
payable (or payables). Both the borrowings and the payables are debts that Home Depot 
must repay within the year. They are therefore classified as current liabilities.
Home Depot’s current assets total $15,302 million; its current liabilities amount to 
$11,269 million. Therefore, the difference between the value of Home Depot’s current 
assets and its current liabilities is $15,302 − $11,269 = $4,033 million. This figure is 
known as Home Depot’s net current assets or net working capital. It roughly measures 
the company’s potential reservoir of cash.
Below the current liabilities Home Depot’s accountants have listed the firm’s longterm liabilities, such as debts that come due after the end of a year. You can see that banks 
and other investors have made long-term loans to Home Depot of $16,869 million.
Home Depot’s liabilities are financial obligations to various parties. For example, 
when Home Depot buys goods from its suppliers, it has a liability to pay for them; 
when it borrows from the bank, it has a liability to repay the loan. Thus the suppliers 
and the bank have first claim on the firm’s assets. What is left over after the liabilities

have been paid off belongs to the shareholders. This figure is known as the shareholders’ equity. For Home Depot the total value of shareholders’ equity amounts to $9,322 
million. Table 3.1 shows that Home Depot’s equity is made up of three parts. One portion, $8,521 million, has resulted from the occasional sale of new shares to investors. 
A much larger amount, $26,995 million, has come from earnings that Home Depot has 
retained and reinvested in the business on the shareholders’ behalf.3
 Finally, treasury 
stock is a large negative number, −$26,194 million. This represents the amount that 
Home Depot has spent on buying back its shares. The money to repurchase them has 
gone out of the firm and reduced shareholders’ equity.
Figure 3.1 shows how the separate items in the balance sheet link together. There 
are two classes of assets—current assets, which will soon be used or turned into cash, 
and long-term or “fixed” assets, which may be either tangible or intangible. There are 
also two classes of liability—current liabilities, which are due for payment shortly, and 
long-term liabilities.
The difference between the assets and the liabilities represents the amount of the 
shareholders’ equity. This is the basic balance sheet identity. Shareholders are sometimes called “residual claimants” on the firm. We mean by this that shareholders’ 
equity is what is left over when the liabilities of the firm are subtracted from its assets:
 Shareholders’ equity = net assets = total assets − total liabilities (3.1)

 Here is an occasional source of confusion. You may be tempted to think of retained earnings as a pile of cash that 
the company has built up from its past operations. But there is absolutely no link between retained earnings and 
cash balances. The earnings that Home Depot has plowed back into the business may have been used to buy new 
equipment, trucks, warehouses, and so on. Typically only a small proportion will be kept in the bank. Notice that 
Home Depot’s balance sheet lists $26,995 in retained earnings but only $1,723 in cash and marketable securities.

FIGURE 3.1 Assets and

When comparing financial statements, analysts often calculate a common-size 
balance sheet, which re-expresses all items as a percentage of total assets. Table 3.2 is 
Home Depot’s common-size balance sheet. The financial manager might look at this 
common-size balance sheet and notice right away that in 2014 receivables accounted 
for a higher proportion of the firm’s assets than they did in the previous year. There 
may be good reasons for this, but the manager might wish to check that the company 
has not become lazy in collecting its customers’ unpaid bills.

All items in the balance 
sheet are expressed as a 
percentage of total assets.
Suppose that Home Depot borrows $500 million by issuing new long-term 
bonds. It places $100 million of the proceeds in the bank and uses $400 million 
to buy new machinery. What items of the balance sheet would change? Would 
shareholders’ equity change?

By the way, it is easy to obtain the financial statements of almost any publicly 
traded firm. Most firms make their annual reports available on the web. You also can 
find key financial statements of most firms at Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com) or 
Google Finance (finance.google.com).
Book Values and Market Values
Throughout this book, we will frequently make a distinction between the book values 
of the assets shown in the balance sheet and their market values.
Items in the balance sheet are valued according to generally accepted accounting 
principles, commonly called GAAP. These state that assets must be shown in the balance sheet at their historical cost adjusted for depreciation. Book values are therefore 
“backward-looking” measures of value. They are based on the past cost of the asset, 
not its current market price or value to the firm. For example, suppose that 2 years 
ago Home Depot built an office building for $30 million and that in today’s market 
the building would sell for $40 million. The book value of the building would be less 
than its market value, and the balance sheet would understate the value of Home 
Depot’s asset.
Or consider a specialized plant that Intel develops for producing special-purpose 
computer chips at a cost of $800 million. The book value of the plant is $800 million 
less accumulated depreciation. But suppose that shortly after the plant is constructed, 
a new chip makes the existing one obsolete. The market value of Intel’s new plant 
could fall by 50% or more. In this case, market value would be less than book value.
The difference between book value and market value is greater for some assets than 
for others. It is zero in the case of cash but potentially very large for fixed assets where 
the accountant starts with initial cost and then depreciates that figure according to a 
prespecified schedule. The purpose of depreciation is to allocate the original cost of 
the asset over its life, and the rules governing the depreciation of asset values do not 
reflect actual loss of market value. Usually the market value of fixed assets is much 
higher than the book value, but sometimes it is less.
