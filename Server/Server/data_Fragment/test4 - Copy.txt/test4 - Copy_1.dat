and firms to send and receive payments quickly and safely over long distances. Banks 
are the obvious providers of payment services, but they are not alone. For example, if 
you buy shares in a money market mutual fund, your money is pooled with that of 
other investors and used to buy safe, short-term securities. You can then write checks 
on this mutual fund investment, just as if you had a bank deposit.
Information Provided by Financial Markets
In well-functioning financial markets, you can see what securities and commodities are 
worth, and you can see—or at least estimate—the rates of return that investors can expect 
on their savings. The information provided by financial markets is often essential to a 
financial manager’s job. Here are three examples of how this information can be used.
Commodity Prices Catalytic converters are used in the exhaust systems of cars and 
light trucks to reduce pollution. The catalysts include platinum, which is traded on the 
New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
In March a manufacturer of catalytic converters is planning production for October. 
How much per ounce should the company budget for purchases of platinum in that 
month? Easy: The company’s CFO looks up the futures price of platinum on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange—$972 per ounce for delivery in October (this was the 
closing price for platinum in March 2016, for delivery in October). The CFO can lock 
in that price if she wishes. The details of such a trade are covered in Chapter 24.
Interest Rates The CFO of Catalytic Concepts has to raise $400 million in new 
financing. She considers an issue of long-term bonds. What will the interest rate on the 
bonds be? To find out, the CFO looks up interest rates on existing bonds traded in 
financial markets.
The results are shown in Table 2.2. Notice how the interest rate climbs as credit 
quality deteriorates: The largest, safest companies, which are rated AAA (“triple-A”), 
can raise long-term debt at a 2.59% interest rate. The interest rates for AA, A, and 
BBB rise to 2.62%, 3.03%, and 4.32%, respectively. BBB companies are still regarded 
as investment grade, that is, good quality, but the next step down takes the investor into 
junk bond territory. The interest rate for BB debt climbs to 5.62%. Single-B companies 
are riskier still, so investors demand 8.32%.
There will be more on bond ratings and interest rates in Chapter 6. But you can see 
how a financial manager can use information from fixed-income markets to forecast 
the interest rate on new debt financing. For example, if Catalytic Concepts can qualify 
as a BBB-rated company, and interest rates are as shown in Table 2.2, it should be able 
to raise new debt financing for approximately 4.32%.
Company Values How much was Callaway Golf worth in March 2016? How about 
Alaska Air Group, Entergy, Yum! Brands, or GE? Table 2.3 shows the market capitalization of each company. We simply multiply the number of shares outstanding by the 
price per share in the stock market. Investors valued Callaway Golf at $821 million 
and GE at $283 billion.

Stock prices and company values summarize investors’ collective assessment 
of how well a company is doing, both its current performance and its future prospects. Thus an increase in stock price sends a positive signal from investors to 
managers.16 That is why top management’s compensation is linked to stock prices. A 
manager who owns shares in his or her company will be motivated to increase the 
company’s market value. This reduces agency costs by aligning the interests of managers and stockholders.
This is one important advantage of going public. A private company can’t use its 
stock price as a measure of performance. It can still compensate managers with shares, 
but the shares will not be valued in a financial market.
Cost of Capital Financial managers look to financial markets to measure, or at 
least estimate, the cost of capital for the firm’s investment projects. The cost of capital 
is the minimum acceptable rate of return on the project. Investment projects offering 
rates of return higher than their cost of capital are worthwhile because they add value; 
they make both the firm and its shareholders better off financially. Projects offering 
rates of return less than the cost of capital subtract value and should not be 
undertaken.17
Thus the hurdle rate for investments inside the corporation is actually set outside 
the corporation. The expected rate of return on investments in financial markets determines the opportunity cost of capital.
The opportunity cost of capital is generally not the interest rate that the firm pays on 
a loan from a bank or insurance company. If the company is making a risky investment, the opportunity cost of capital is the expected rate of return that investors can 
achieve in financial markets at the same level of risk. The expected rate of return on 
risky securities is normally well above the interest rate on corporate borrowing.
We introduced the cost of capital in Chapter 1, but this brief reminder may help to 
fix the idea. We cover the cost of capital in detail in Chapters 11 and 12.

16 We can’t claim that investors’ assessments of value are always correct. Finance can be a risky and dangerous 
business—dangerous for your wealth, that is. With hindsight we see horrible mistakes by investors, for example, 
the gross overvaluation of Internet and telecom companies in 2000. On average, however, it appears that financial markets collect and assess information quickly and accurately. We’ll discuss this issue again in Chapter 7.
17 Of course, the firm may invest for other reasons. For example, it may invest in pollution control equipment for 
a factory. The equipment may not generate a cash return but may still be worth investing in to meet legal and 
ethical obligations.

bre22619_ch02_032-055.indd 49 10/06/16 03:41 PM
The Crisis of 2007–2009
The financial crisis of 2007–2009 raised many questions, but it settled one question 
conclusively: Yes, financial markets and institutions are important. When financial 
markets and institutions ceased to operate properly, the world was pushed into a global 
recession.
The financial crisis had its roots in the easy-money policies that were pursued by 
the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks following the collapse of the Internet 
and telecom stock bubble in 2000. At the same time, large balance-of-payments surpluses in Asian economies were invested back into U.S. debt securities. This also 
helped to push down interest rates and contribute to lax credit.
Banks took advantage of this cheap money to expand the supply of subprime mortgages to low-income borrowers. Many banks tempted would-be homeowners with low 
initial payments, offset by significantly higher payments later.18 (Some home buyers 
were betting on escalating housing prices so that they could resell or refinance before 
the higher payments kicked in.) One lender is even said to have advertised what it 
dubbed its “NINJA” loan—NINJA standing for “No Income, No Job, and No Assets.” 
Most subprime mortgages were then packaged together into mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) that could be resold. But, instead of selling these securities to investors 
who could best bear the risk, many banks kept large quantities of the loans on their 
own books or sold them to other banks.
The widespread availability of mortgage finance fueled a dramatic increase in 
house prices, which doubled in the 5 years ending June 2006. At that point, prices 
started to slide and homeowners began to default on their mortgages. A year later, 
Bear Stearns, a large investment bank, announced huge losses on the mortgage investments that were held in two of its hedge funds. By the spring of 2008, Bear Stearns 
was on the verge of bankruptcy, and the U.S. Federal Reserve arranged for it to be 
acquired by JPMorgan Chase.
The crisis peaked in September 2008, when the U.S. government was obliged to take 
over the giant federal mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which 
had invested several hundred billion dollars in subprime mortgage-backed securities. 
Over the next few days, the financial system started to melt down. Both Merrill Lynch 
and Lehman Brothers were in danger of failing. On September 14, the government 
arranged for Bank of America to take over Merrill in return for financial guarantees. 
However, it did nothing to rescue Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy protection the next day. Two days later, the government reluctantly lent $85 billion to the 
giant insurance company AIG, which had insured huge volumes of mortgage-backed 
securities and other bonds against default. The following day, the Treasury unveiled its 
first proposal to spend $700 billion to purchase “toxic” mortgage-backed securities.
After the failure of Lehman and the forced rescues of Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie 
Mac, Merrill Lynch, and AIG, investors and financial institutions had to ask, “Who will 
be next? Do I dare trade with or lend money to Bank X?” In many situations, the cautious 
answer was “No.” Customary day-to-day financial transactions were canceled or completed on onerous terms.19 At the same time, trading in MBSs and other hard-to-value 
securities dried up; it therefore became even harder to know what these securities were 
worth. As banks and other financial institutions became reluctant to trade securities or 
lend to one another, the supply of credit to the economy contracted and business investment was cut back. The U.S. economy suffered one of its worst setbacks since the Great 
Depression. Unemployment rose rapidly and business bankruptcies tripled.
2.4
18 With a so-called option ARM loan, the minimum mortgage payment was often not even sufficient to cover 
that month’s interest on the loan. The unpaid interest was then added to the amount of the mortgage, so the 
homeowner was burdened by an ever-increasing mortgage that one day would need to be paid off.
19  The interest rate on interbank loans rose in 2008 to 4.6% above the rate on U.S. Treasury debt. The normal 
spread over Treasuries is less than .5%.

Few developed economies escaped the crisis. As well as suffering from a collapse in 
their own housing markets, a number of foreign banks had made large investments in 
U.S. subprime mortgages and had to be rescued by their governments. Many European 
governments were already heavily in debt and, as the cost of the bank bailouts mounted, 
investors began to worry about the ability of the governments to repay their debts. 
Thus in Europe, the banking crisis became entwined with a sovereign debt crisis.
The invention of MBSs also made mortgages liquid. They 
are actively traded among banks, insurance companies, 
mutual funds, pension funds, and endowments.
The MBS market has grown explosively. With the growth 
came more and more complexity. Issuers were not content 
with the simple pass-through MBS described earlier. They 
issued complicated packages of securities called tranches.
The most senior tranches were given first call on all cash 
flows from the mortgage portfolio and were viewed as almost 
risk-free. Bond-rating agencies gave their highest, triple-A ratings to the senior tranches, even for MBSs based on subprime mortgages for homeowners with weak credit. Many 
investors in triple-A tranches lost a lot of money in the crisis of 
2007–2009. We discuss bond ratings in Chapter 6.
The MBS market survived. It is still by far the largest source 
of mortgage financing. By 2015, the aggregate MBSs outstanding exceeded $2 trillion. MBSs are part of a broader 
market for asset-backed securities, which include securities 
that work like MBSs but are based on portfolios of other types 
of assets, including car loans, bank loans to businesses, and 
financing for commercial real estate.
Mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) provide another example of how financial markets convey savings to finance 
investment in real assets. In this case, the real assets 
are homes, which homeowners finance in part with mortgage loans.
In the old days—the 1960s, for example—most mortgage 
loans were made by local banks, savings banks, and savings 
and loan institutions (S&Ls), which accepted deposits and savings accounts and made mortgage and other local loans. We 
will use an S&L as the example. The flow of savings would be 
as described by the figure in Panel a, at the bottom of this box.
The typical mortgage was long term, up to 30 years maturity, with a fixed interest rate. The S&Ls’ liabilities—chiefly savings accounts—had much shorter maturities, perhaps a year 
or two on average. The S&Ls were therefore “borrowing 
short, lending long,” a dangerous investment strategy. When 
interest rates rose in the 1970s and 1980s, the S&Ls’ interest 
costs on savings accounts rose, too, but their interest income 
was locked up in long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. Losses 
mounted. The S&L crisis of the 1980s followed.*
The invention of the MBS allowed S&Ls to eliminate the risks 
of borrowing short and lending long. You can still get a mortgage 
from your local S&L, but now the S&L does not have to keep it. 
The S&L originates the mortgage, but will probably resell it to an 
MBS issuer—for example, Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association or FNMA†) or Bank of America. The issuer combines your mortgage with hundreds or thousands of others and 
issues an MBS backed by the combined portfolio. The MBS is 
sold to investors such as life insurance companies that want to 
hold long-term, fixed-rate obligations. Cash flows from the mortgage portfolio are passed through to investors.‡
Suppose a life insurance company purchases an MBS. The 
flow of savings would now match the figure in Panel b.
Finance in Practice Mortgage-Backed Securities
*For a history of the crisis, see Edward J. Kane, The S&L Insurance Mess: How 
Did It Happen? (Washington, D.C.: Urban Institute Press, 1989).
†Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) are 
government-sponsored entities (GSEs) charged with increasing the availability 
of mortgage credit. The GSEs purchase “conforming loans” and package and 
resell them as MBSs. Nonconforming loans—for example, large, “jumbo” 
mortgages—are packaged by banks such as Citigroup or Bank of America.
‡ You still send monthly payments to your local S&L. The S&L extracts a small 
servicing fee and sends your payments along to the MBS issuer, which also 
extracts a small servicing fee. Net cash flows from the portfolio

To grow from small beginnings to a major corporation, FedEx needed to make good investment and financing decisions.
Frank Kovalchek via Alaskan Dude/Flickr/CC BY 2.0
To carry on business, a corporation needs an 
almost endless variety of assets. Some are tangible assets such as plant and machinery, office 
buildings, and vehicles; others are intangible assets 
such as brand names and patents. Corporations finance 
these assets by borrowing, by reinvesting profits back 
into the firm, and by selling additional shares to the 
firm’s shareholders.
Financial managers, therefore, face two broad questions. First, what investments should the corporation 
make? Second, how should it pay for these investments? 
Investment decisions spend money. Financing decisions raise money for investment.
We start this chapter with examples of recent investment and financing decisions by major U.S. and foreign 
corporations. We review what a corporation is and 
describe the roles of its top financial managers. We then 
turn to the financial goal of the corporation, which is 
usually expressed as maximizing value, or at least 
adding value. Financial managers add value whenever 
the corporation can invest to earn a higher return than 
its shareholders can earn for themselves.
But managers are human beings; they cannot be 
perfect servants who always and everywhere maximize 
value. We will consider the conflicts of interest that 
arise in large corporations and how corporate governance helps to align the interests of managers and 
shareholders.
If we ask managers to maximize value, can the corporation also be a good citizen? Won’t the managers be 
tempted to try unethical or illegal financial tricks? They 
may sometimes be tempted, but wise managers realize 
that such tricks are not just dishonest; they almost 
always destroy value, not increase it. More challenging 
are the gray areas where the line between ethical and 
unethical financial actions is hard to draw.
Finally, we look ahead to the rest of this book and look 
back to some entertaining snippets of financial history.

bre22619_ch01_002-031.indd 4 10/06/16 03:32 PM
1.1 Investment and Financing Decisions
Fred Smith is best known today as the founder of FedEx. But in 1965 he was still a 
sophomore at Yale, where he wrote an economics term paper arguing that delivery 
systems were not keeping up with increasing needs for speed and dependability.1
He later joined his stepfather at a struggling equipment and maintenance firm for air 
carriers. He observed firsthand the difficulties of shipping spare parts on short notice. 
He saw the need for an integrated air and ground delivery system with a central hub 
that could connect a large number of points more efficiently than a point-to-point 
delivery system. In 1971, at the age of 27, Smith founded Federal Express.
Like many start-up firms, Federal Express flirted again and again with failure. 
Smith and his family had an inheritance of a few million dollars, but this was far from 
enough. The young company needed to purchase and retrofit a small fleet of aging 
Dassault Falcon jets; build a central-hub facility; and hire and train pilots, delivery, 
and office staff. The initial source of capital was short-term bank loans. Because of the 
company’s shaky financial position, the bank demanded that the planes be used as 
collateral and that Smith personally guarantee the loan with his own money.
In April 1973, the company went live with a fleet of 14 jets, servicing 25 U.S. cities 
out of its Memphis hub. By then, the company had spent $25 million and was effectively flat broke, without enough funds to pay for its weekly delivery of jet fuel. 
In desperation, it managed to acquire a bank loan for $23.7 million. This loan had to be 
backed by a guarantee from General Dynamics, which in return acquired an option to 
buy the company. (Today, General Dynamics must regret that it never exercised 
this option.)
In November of that year, the company finally achieved some financial stability 
when it raised $24.5 million from venture capitalists, investment firms that provide 
funds and advice to young companies in return for a partial ownership share. Eventually, venture capitalists invested about $90 million in Federal Express.
In 1977, private firms were allowed for the first time to compete with the Postal 
Service in package delivery. Federal Express responded by expanding its operations. 
It acquired seven Boeing 727s, each with about seven times the capacity of the Falcon 
jets. To pay for these new investments, Federal Express raised about $19 million by 
selling shares of stock to the general public in an initial public offering (IPO). The new 
stockholders became part-owners of the company in proportion to the number of 
shares they purchased.
From this point on, success followed success, and the company invested heavily to 
expand its air fleet as well as its supporting infrastructure. It introduced an automated 
shipping system and a bar-coded tracking system. In 1994, it launched its fedex.com
website for online package tracking. It opened several new hubs across the United 
States as well as in Canada, France, the Philippines, and China. In 2007, FedEx (as the 
company was now called) became the world’s largest airline measured by number of 
planes. FedEx also invested in other companies, capped by the acquisition of Kinko’s 
for $2.4 billion in 2004. By 2016, FedEx had 325,000 employees, annual revenue of 
$49 billion, and a stock market value of almost $40 billion. Its name had become a 
verb—to “FedEx a package” was to ship it overnight.
Even in retrospect, FedEx’s success was hardly a sure thing. Fred Smith’s idea was 
inspired, but its implementation was complex and difficult. FedEx had to make good 
investment decisions. In the beginning, these decisions were constrained by lack of 
financing. For example, used Falcon jets were the only option, given the young company’s precarious financial position. At first it could service only a short list of the 
major cities. As the company grew, its investment decisions became more complex. 
Which type of planes should it buy? When should it expand coverage to Europe and

 Legend has it that Smith received a grade of C on this paper. In fact, he doesn’t remember the grade.

Asia? How many operations hubs should it build? What computer and tracking systems were necessary to keep up with the increasing package volume and geographic 
coverage? Which companies should it acquire as it expanded its range of services?
FedEx also needed to make good financing decisions. For example, how should it 
raise the money it needed for investment? In the beginning, these choices were limited 
to family money and bank loans. As the company grew, its range of choices expanded. 
Eventually it was able to attract funding from venture capitalists, but this posed new 
questions. How much cash did the firm need to raise from the venture capitalists? How 
big a share in the firm would the venture capitalists demand in return? The initial public 
offering of stock prompted similar questions. How many shares should the company try 
to sell? At what price? As the company grew, it raised more funds by borrowing money 
from its banks and by selling publicly traded bonds to investors. At each point, it needed 
to decide on the proper form and terms of financing as well as the amounts to be raised.
In short, FedEx needed to be good at finance. It had a head start over potential 
competitors, but a series of bad financial decisions would have sunk the company. 
No two companies’ histories are the same, but, like FedEx, all successful companies 
must make good investment and financing decisions. And, as with FedEx, those 
decisions range from prosaic and obvious to difficult and strategically crucial.
Let’s widen our discussion. Table 1.1 gives an example of a recent investment and 
financing decision for 11 corporations. Seven are U.S. corporations. Four are foreign: 
Virgin Atlantic’s headquarters are in London, TransCanada’s in Calgary, LVMH’s in 
Paris,2
 and Vale’s in Rio de Janeiro. We have chosen very large public corporations 
that you are likely to be familiar with. You may have flown with Virgin Atlantic, 
shopped at Walmart, or posted a picture on Facebook.

Take a look at the decisions now. We think you will agree that they appear 
sensible—at least there is nothing obviously wrong with them. But if you are new to 
finance, it may be difficult to think about why these companies made these decisions 
and not others.
The Investment (Capital Budgeting) Decision
Investment decisions, such as those shown in Table 1.1, are also called capital 
budgeting or capital expenditure (CAPEX) decisions. Some of the investments in 
the table, such as Walmart’s new stores or Virgin Atlantic’s new planes, involve 
tangible assets—assets that you can touch and kick. Others involve intangible assets, 
such as research and development (R&D), advertising, and the design of computer 
software. For example, major pharmaceutical manufacturers invest billions every year 
on R&D for new drugs.
Most of the investments in Table 1.1 have long-term consequences. For example, 
the planes acquired by Virgin Atlantic may still be flying 20 or 30 years from now. 
Other investments may pay off in only a few months. For example, with the approach 
of the Christmas holidays, Walmart spends nearly $50 billion to stock up its warehouses and retail stores. As the goods are sold over the following months, the company 
recovers its investment in these inventories.
The world of business can be intensely competitive, and corporations prosper only 
if they can keep launching new products or services. In some cases, the costs and risks 
of doing so are amazingly large. For example, the cost of developing the Gorgon 
natural gas field in Australia has been estimated at $54 billion. It’s not surprising that 
this cost is being shared among several major energy companies. But do not think of 
companies as making billion-dollar investments on a daily basis. Most investment 
decisions are smaller, such as the purchase of a truck, machine tool, or computer 
system. Corporations make thousands of such investments each year. The cumulative 
amount of these small expenditures can be just as large as the occasional jumbo investments, such as those shown in Table 1.1.
Not all investments succeed. In October 2011 Hewlett-Packard (HP) paid $11.1 
billion to acquire the British software company Autonomy. Just 13 months later, 
HP wrote down the value of this investment by $8.8 billion. HP claimed that it was 
misled by improper accounting at Autonomy. Nevertheless, the Autonomy acquisition 
was a disastrous investment for HP. HP’s CEO was fired in short order.
There are no free guarantees in finance. But you can tilt the odds in your favor if 
you learn the tools of investment analysis and apply them intelligently. We cover these 
tools in detail later in this book.
The Financing Decision
The financial manager’s second main responsibility is to raise the money that the firm 
requires for its investments and operations. This is the financing decision. When a 
company needs to raise money, it can invite investors to put up cash in exchange for a 
share of future profits, or it can promise to pay back the investors’ cash plus a fixed 
rate of interest. In the first case, the investors receive shares of stock and become 
shareholders, part-owners of the corporation. The investors in this case are referred to 
as equity investors, who contribute equity financing. In the second case, the investors 
are lenders, that is, debt investors, who one day must be repaid. The choice between 
debt and equity financing is often called the capital structure decision. Here “capital” 
refers to the firm’s sources of long-term financing. A firm that is seeking to raise longterm financing is said to be “raising capital.”
Notice the essential difference between the investment and financing decisions. 
When the firm invests, it acquires real assets, which are then used to produce the 
firm’s goods and services. The firm finances its investment in real assets by issuing 
financial assets to investors. A share of stock is a financial asset, which has value as a

claim on the firm’s real assets and on the income that those assets will produce. 
A bank loan is a financial asset also. It gives the bank the right to get its money back plus 
interest. If the firm’s operations can’t generate enough income to repay the bank, the 
bank can force the firm into bankruptcy and stake a claim on its real assets. Financial 
assets that can be purchased and traded by investors in public markets are called securities. The shares of stock issued by the public corporations in Table 1.1 are all securities. 
Entergy’s 10-year bond in Table 1.1 is a security. But a bank loan from JPMorgan to 
Entergy is not called a security unless the bank resells the loan to public investors.
The firm can issue an almost endless variety of financial assets. Suppose it decides 
to borrow. It can issue debt to investors, or it can borrow from a bank. It can borrow for 
1 year or 20 years. If it borrows for 20 years, it can reserve the right to pay off the debt 
early if interest rates fall. It can borrow in Paris, receiving and promising to repay 
euros, or it can borrow dollars in New York. (As Table 1.1 shows, Ford chose to borrow U.S. dollars, but it could have borrowed euros or Japanese yen instead.)
In some ways, financing decisions are less important than investment decisions. 
Financial managers say that “value comes mainly from the investment side of the balance sheet.” Also, the most successful corporations sometimes have the simplest 
financing strategies. Take Microsoft as an example. It is one of the world’s most valuable corporations. In early 2016, Microsoft shares traded for $53 each. There were 7.91 
billion shares outstanding. Therefore Microsoft’s market value—its market capitalization or market cap—was 53 × 7.91 = $419 billion. Where did this market value come 
from? It came from Microsoft’s products, from its brand name and worldwide customer base, from its R&D, and from its ability to make profitable future investments. 
It did not come from sophisticated financing. Microsoft’s financing strategy is very 
simple: It finances almost all investment by retaining and reinvesting operating cash flow.
Financing decisions may not add much value compared to good investment decisions, but they can destroy value if they are stupid or ambushed by bad news. For 
example, when a consortium of investment companies bought the energy giant TXU in 
2007, the company took on an additional $40 billion in debt. This may not have been a 
stupid decision, but it did prove fatal. The consortium did not foresee the expansion of 
shale gas production and the resulting sharp fall in natural gas and electricity prices, 
and in April 2014 the company (renamed Energy Future Holdings) was bankrupt.
We have emphasized the financial manager’s responsibility for two decisions:
The investment decision = purchase of real assets
The financing decision = sale of financial assets
But this is an oversimplification because the financial manager is also involved in many 
other day-to-day activities that are essential to the smooth operation of a business. 
Are the following capital budgeting or financing decisions? (Hint: In one case the 
answer is “both.”)
a. Intel decides to spend $7 billion to develop a new microprocessor factory.
b. BMW borrows 350 million euros (€350 million) from Deutsche Bank.
c. Royal Dutch Shell constructs a pipeline to bring natural gas onshore from a 
production platform in Australia.
d. Avon spends €200 million to launch a new range of cosmetics in European 
markets.
e. Pfizer issues new shares to buy a small biotech company.

For example, if the firm sells goods or services on credit, it needs to make sure that its 
customers pay on time. Corporations that operate internationally must constantly transfer cash from one currency to another. And the manager must keep an eye on the risks 
that the firm runs and ensure that they don’t land the firm in a pickle.

 In the United States, corporations are identified by the label “Corporation,” “Incorporated,” or “Inc.,” as in 
Caterpillar Inc. The United Kingdom identifies public corporations by “plc” (short for “Public Limited 
Corporation”). French corporations have the suffix “SA” (“Société Anonyme”). The corresponding labels in 
Germany are “GmbH” (“Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung”) and “AG” (“Aktiengesellschaft”).
4
 “Shareholder” and “stockholder” mean exactly the same thing and are used interchangeably.
1.2 What Is a Corporation?
We have been referring to “corporations.” But before going too far or too fast, we need 
to offer some basic definitions.
A corporation is a distinct, permanent legal entity. Suppose you decide to create a 
new corporation.3
 You would work with a lawyer to prepare articles of incorporation,
which set out the purpose of the business and how it is to be financed, managed, and 
governed. These articles must conform to the laws of the state in which the business is 
incorporated. For many purposes, the corporation is considered a resident of its state. 
For example, it can enter into contracts, borrow or lend money, and sue or be sued. 
It pays its own taxes (but it cannot vote!).
A corporation’s owners are called shareholders or stockholders.4
 The shareholders 
do not directly own the business’s real assets (factories, oil wells, stores, etc.). Instead 
they have indirect ownership via financial assets (the shares of the corporation).
A corporation is legally distinct from the shareholders. Therefore, the shareholders 
have limited liability and cannot be held personally responsible for the corporation’s 
debts. When the U.S. financial corporation Lehman Brothers failed in 2008, no one 
demanded that its stockholders put up more money to cover Lehman’s massive debts. 
Shareholders can lose their entire investment in a corporation, but no more.

The owners of a

Business Organization
Suppose you buy a building and open a restaurant. You have invested in the building itself, 
kitchen equipment, dining-room furnishings, plus various other assets. If you do not incorporate, you own these assets personally, as the sole proprietor of the business. If you have 
borrowed money from a bank to start the business, then you are personally responsible for 
this debt. If the business loses money and cannot pay the bank, then the bank can demand

a. A patent.
b. A share of stock issued by Wells Fargo Bank.
c. A blast furnace in a steelmaking factory.
d. A mortgage loan taken out to help pay for a new home.
e. After a successful advertising campaign, potential customers trust FedEx to 
deliver packages promptly and reliably.
f. An IOU (“I owe you”) from your brother-in-law.

Chapter 1 Goals and Governance of the Corporation 9
bre22619_ch01_002-031.indd 9 10/06/16 03:32 PM
When a corporation is first established, its shares may be privately owned by a 
small group of investors, perhaps the company’s managers and a few backers. In this 
case, the shares are not publicly traded and the company is closely held. Eventually, 
when the firm grows and new shares are issued to raise additional capital, its shares 
are traded in public markets such as the New York Stock Exchange. Such corporations 
are known as public companies. Most well-known corporations in the United States 
are public companies with widely dispersed shareholdings. In other countries, it is 
more common for large corporations to remain in private hands, and many public 
companies may be controlled by just a handful of investors.
A large public corporation may have hundreds of thousands of shareholders, who 
together own the business. An individual may have 100 shares, receive 100 votes, and 
be entitled to a tiny fraction of the firm’s income and value. On the other hand, a 
pension fund or insurance company may own millions of shares, receive millions of 
votes, and have a correspondingly large stake in the firm’s performance.
Public shareholders cannot possibly manage or control the corporation directly. 
Instead, they elect a board of directors, who in turn appoint the top managers and 
monitor their performance. This separation of ownership and control gives corporations 
permanence. Even if managers quit or are dismissed, the corporation survives. Today’s 
stockholders can sell all their shares to new investors without disrupting the operations 
of the business. Corporations can, in principle, live forever, and in practice they may 
survive many human lifetimes. One of the oldest corporations is the Hudson’s Bay 
Company, which was formed in 1670 to profit from the fur trade between northern 
Canada and England. The company still operates as one of Canada’s leading retail chains.
The separation of corporate ownership and control can also have a downside, for it 
can open the door for managers and directors to act in their own interests rather than in 
the stockholders’ interest. We return to this problem later in the chapter.
There are other disadvantages to being a corporation. One is the cost, in both time 
and money, of managing the corporation’s legal machinery. These costs are particularly burdensome for small businesses.
There is also an important tax drawback to corporations in the United States. 
Because the corporation is a separate legal entity, it is taxed separately. So corporations pay tax on their profits, and shareholders are taxed again when they receive 
dividends from the company or sell their shares at a profit. By contrast, income generated by businesses that are not incorporated is taxed just once as personal income.6
Other Forms of Business Organization
Corporations do not have to be prominent, multinational businesses such as those 
listed in Table 1.1. You can organize a local plumbing contractor or barber shop as a 
corporation if you want to take the trouble. But most corporations are larger

S-corporations
that you raise cash by selling other assets—your car or house, for example—in order to repay 
the loan. But if you incorporate the restaurant business, and then the corporation borrows 
from the bank, your other assets are shielded from the restaurant’s debts. Of course, 
incorporation also means that the bank will be more cautious in lending, because the bank 
will have no recourse to your other assets.5
Notice that if you incorporate your business, you exchange direct ownership of its real 
assets (the building, kitchen equipment, etc.) for indirect ownership via financial assets 
(the shares of the new corporation). ■
5
 The bank may ask you to put up personal assets as collateral for the loan to your restaurant corporation. But it 
has to ask and get your agreement. It doesn’t have to ask if your business is a sole proprietorship.
6
 The U.S. tax system is somewhat unusual in this respect. To avoid taxing the same income twice, many other 
countries give shareholders at least some credit for the taxes that the corporation has already paid.

businesses or businesses that aspire to grow. Small “mom-and-pop” businesses are 
usually organized as sole proprietorships.
What about the middle ground? What about businesses that grow too large for sole 
proprietorships but don’t want to reorganize as corporations? For example, suppose 
you wish to pool money and expertise with some friends or business associates. 
You can form a partnership and enter into a partnership agreement that sets out 
how decisions are to be made and how profits are to be split up. Partners, like sole 
proprietors, face unlimited liability. If the business runs into difficulties, each partner 
can be held responsible for all the business’s debts.
Partnerships have a tax advantage. Partnerships, unlike corporations, do not have 
to pay income taxes. The partners pay personal income taxes on their shares of 
the profits.
Some businesses are hybrids that combine the tax advantage of a partnership with 
the limited liability advantage of a corporation. In a limited partnership, partners 
are classified as general or limited. General partners manage the business and have 
unlimited personal liability for its debts. Limited partners are liable only for the money 
they invest and do not participate in management.
Many states allow limited liability partnerships (LLPs) or limited liability companies (LLCs). These are partnerships in which all partners have limited liability. 
Another variation on the theme is the professional corporation (PC), which is 
commonly used by doctors, lawyers, and accountants. In this case, the business 
has limited liability, but the professionals can still be sued personally, for example, 
for malpractice.
Most large investment banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs started 
life as partnerships. But eventually these companies and their financing requirements 
grew too large for them to continue as partnerships, and they reorganized as corporations. The partnership form of organization does not work well when ownership is 
widespread and separation of ownership and management is essential.
1.3 Who Is the Financial Manager?
What do financial managers do for a living? That simple question can be answered in 
several ways. We can start with financial managers’ job titles. Most large corporations 
have a chief financial officer (CFO), who oversees the work of all financial staff. 
As you can see from Figure 1.1, the CFO is deeply involved in financial policy and 
financial planning and is in constant contact with the chief executive officer (CEO) 
and other top management. The CFO is the most important financial voice of the 
corporation and explains earnings results and forecasts to investors and the media.

Below the CFO are usually a treasurer and a controller. The treasurer looks after 
the firm’s cash, raises new capital, and maintains relationships with banks and other 
investors that hold the firm’s securities. The controller prepares the financial statements, manages the firm’s internal budgets and accounting, and looks after its tax 
affairs. Thus the treasurer’s main function is to obtain and manage the firm’s capital, 
whereas the controller ensures that the money is used efficiently.

Responsible for budgeting,

In large corporations, financial managers are responsible for organizing and supervising the capital budgeting process. However, major capital investment projects are 
so closely tied to plans for product development, production, and marketing that 
managers from these other areas are inevitably drawn into planning and analyzing the 
projects. If the firm has staff members specializing in corporate planning, they are 
naturally involved in capital budgeting too. For this reason, we will use the term financial manager to refer to anyone responsible for an investment or financing decision. 
Often we will use the term collectively for all the managers drawn into such decisions.
Now let’s go beyond job titles. What is the essential role of the financial manager? 
Figure 1.2 gives one answer. The figure traces how money flows from investors to the 
corporation and back again to investors. The flow starts when cash is raised from 
investors (arrow 1 in the figure). The cash could come from banks or from securities 
sold to investors in financial markets. The cash is then used to pay for the real assets 
(investment projects) needed for the corporation’s business (arrow 2). Later, as the 
business operates, the assets generate cash inflows (arrow 3). That cash is either 
reinvested (arrow 4a) or returned to the investors who furnished the money in the first 
place (arrow 4b). Of course, the choice between arrows 4a and 4b is constrained by the 
promises made when cash was raised at arrow 1. For example, if the firm borrows 
money from a bank at arrow 1, it must repay this money plus interest at arrow 4b.
You can see examples of arrows 4a and 4b in Table 1.1. Facebook financed its 
investments by reinvesting earnings (arrow 4a). Procter & Gamble decided to return 
cash to shareholders by buying back its stock (arrow 4b). It could have chosen instead 
to pay the money out as additional cash dividends, also on arrow 4b.
Notice how the financial manager stands between the firm and outside investors. 
On the one hand, the financial manager is involved in the firm’s operations,

she deals with financial institutions and other investors and with financial markets 
such as the New York Stock Exchange. We say more about these financial institutions 
and markets in the next chapter.
1.4 Goals of the Corporation
Shareholders Want Managers to Maximize Market Value
For small corporations, shareholders and management may be one and the same. 
But for large corporations, separation of ownership and management is a practical 
necessity. For example, Walmart has nearly 300,000 shareholders. There is no way 
that these shareholders can be actively involved in management; it would be like trying 
to run New York City by town meetings. Authority has to be delegated.
How can shareholders effectively delegate decision making when they all have 
different tastes, wealth, time horizons, personal opportunities, and tolerance for 
risk? Delegation can work only if the shareholders have a common goal. Fortunately 
there is a natural financial objective on which almost all shareholders can agree: 
Maximize the current market value of shareholders’ investment in the firm.
This simple, unqualified goal makes sense when the shareholders have access to 
well-functioning financial markets and institutions. Access gives them the flexibility 
to manage their own savings and consumption plans, leaving the corporation’s financial managers with only one task, to increase market value. For example, a corporation’s roster of shareholders will usually include both risk-averse and risk-tolerant 
investors. You might expect the risk-averse to say, “Sure, maximize value, but don’t 
touch too many high-risk projects.” Instead, they say, “Risky projects are okay, provided that expected profits are more than enough to offset the risks. If this firm ends 
up too risky for my taste, I’ll adjust my investment portfolio to make it safer.” 
For example, the risk-averse shareholder can shift more of his or her portfolio to safe 
assets, such as U.S. government bonds. Shareholders can also just say good-bye, 
selling off shares of the risky firm and buying shares in a safer one. If the risky investments increase market value, the departing shareholders are better off than they would 
be if the risky investments were turned down.

Foundations of the

Value Maximization
Fast-Track Wireless shares trade for $20. It has just announced a “bet the company” 
investment in a high-risk, but potentially revolutionary, WhyFi technology. Investors note the 
risk of failure but are even more impressed with the technology’s upside. They conclude 
that the possibility of very high future profits justifies a higher share price. The price goes 
up to $23.
Caspar Milquetoast, a thoughtful but timid shareholder, notes the downside risks and 
decides that it’s time for a change. He sells out to more risk-tolerant investors. But he sells at 
$23 per share, not $20. Thus he captures the value added by the WhyFi project without 
having to bear the project’s risks. Those risks are transferred to other investors, who are 
more risk-tolerant or more optimistic.
In a well-functioning stock market, there is always a pool of investors ready to bear 
downside risks if the upside potential is sufficiently attractive. We know that the upside 
potential was sufficient in this case, because Fast-Track stock attracted investors willing to 
pay $23 per share. ■

bre22619_ch01_002-031.indd 13 10/06/16 03:32 PM
The same principles apply to the timing of a corporation’s cash flows, as the 
following Self-Test illustrates.
Sometimes you hear managers speak as if the corporation has other goals. For 
example, they may say that their job is to “maximize profits.” That sounds reasonable. 
After all, don’t shareholders want their company to be profitable? But taken literally, 
profit maximization is not a well-defined corporate objective. Here are two reasons:
1. Maximize profits? Which year’s profits? A corporation may be able to increase 
current profits by cutting back on outlays for maintenance or staff training, but that 
will not add value unless the outlays were wasteful in the first place. Shareholders 
will not welcome higher short-term profits if long-term profits are damaged.
2. A company may be able to increase future profits by cutting this year’s dividend 
and investing the freed-up cash in the firm. That is not in the shareholders’ best 
interest if the company earns only a very low rate of return on the extra investment.
Maximizing—or at least maintaining—value is necessary for the long-run survival 
of the corporation. Suppose, for example, that its managers forget about value and decide 
that the only goal is to increase the market share of its products. So the managers cut 
prices aggressively to attract new customers, even when this leads to continuing losses. 
As losses mount, the corporation finds it more and more difficult to borrow money and 
sooner or later cannot pay existing debts. Nor can it raise new equity financing if shareholders see that new equity investment will follow previous investments down the drain.
This firm’s managers would probably pay the price for this business malpractice. 
For example, outside investors would see an opportunity for easy money. They could 
buy the firm from its current shareholders, toss out the managers, and reemphasize 
value rather than market share. The investors would profit from the increase in value 
under new management.
Managers who pursue goals that destroy value often end in early retirement—
another reason that the natural financial goal of the corporation is to maximize 
market value.
The Investment Trade-Off Okay, let’s take the objective as maximizing market 
value, or at least adding market value. But why do some investments increase market 
value, while others reduce it? The answer is given by Figure 1.3, which sets out the 
fundamental trade-off for corporate investment decisions. The corporation has a 
proposed investment project (the purchase of a real asset). Suppose it has sufficient 
cash on hand to finance the project. The financial manager is trying to decide whether 
to go ahead. If he or she decides not to invest, the corporation can pay out the cash 
to shareholders, say as an extra dividend. (The investment and dividend arrows in 
Figure 1.3 are arrows 2 and 4b in Figure 1.2.)
Assume that the financial manager is acting in the interests of the corporation’s 
owners, its stockholders. What do these stockholders want the financial manager to do?

The answer depends on the rate of return on the investment project and on the rate of 
return that stockholders can earn by investing in financial markets. If the return offered 
by the investment project is higher than the rate of return that shareholders can get by 
investing on their own, then the shareholders would vote for the investment project. 
If the investment project offers a lower return than shareholders can achieve on their 
own, the shareholders would vote to cancel the project and take the cash instead.
Figure 1.3 could apply to Virgin Atlantic’s decisions to invest in new aircraft. 
Suppose the company has cash set aside to buy five more Airbus A350-1000s. It could 
go ahead with the purchase, or it could choose to cancel the investment and instead pay 
out the cash to its stockholders. If it pays out the cash, the stockholders could then 
invest for themselves.
Suppose that Virgin’s investment in new planes is just about as risky as the stock 
market and that investment in the stock market offers a 10% expected rate of return. 
If the new planes offer a superior rate of return, say 20%, then Virgin’s stockholders 
would be happy to let the company keep the cash and invest it in the new planes. 
If the planes offer only a 5% return, then the stockholders are better off with the cash 
and without the new project; in that case, the financial manager should turn down 
the project.
As long as a corporation’s proposed investments offer higher rates of return than its 
shareholders can earn for themselves in the stock market (or in other financial 
markets), its shareholders will applaud the investments and the market value of the 
firm will increase. But if the company earns an inferior return, shareholders boo, 
market value falls, and stockholders clamor to get their money back so that they can 
invest on their own.
In our example, the minimum acceptable rate of return on Virgin’s new aircraft 
is 10%. This minimum rate of return is called the hurdle rate or opportunity cost of 
capital. It is called an opportunity cost of capital because it depends on the alternative 
investment opportunities available to shareholders in financial markets. Whenever a 
corporation invests cash in a new project, its shareholders lose the opportunity to 
invest the cash on their own. Corporations increase value by accepting investment 
projects that earn more than the opportunity cost of capital.
Figure 1.3, which compares rates of return on investment projects with the opportunity cost of capital, illustrates a general principle: A corporation should direct cash to 
investments that add market value, compared with the investments that shareholders 
could make on their own.7

 We have mentioned 5% or 20% as possible future rates of return on Virgin Atlantic’s new planes. We will see 
in Chapter 8 that future rates of return are sometimes difficult to calculate and interpret. The general 
principle always holds, however. In Chapters 8 and 9 we show you how to apply the principle by calculating 
the net present value (NPV) of investment projects.

Chapter 1 Goals and Governance of the Corporation 15
bre22619_ch01_002-031.indd 15 10/06/16 03:32 PM
Notice that the opportunity cost of capital depends on the risk of the proposed 
investment project. Why? It’s not just because shareholders are risk-averse. It’s also 
because shareholders have to trade off risk against return when they invest on their 
own. The safest investments, such as U.S. government debt, offer low rates of return. 
Investments with higher expected rates of return—the stock market, for example—are 
riskier and sometimes deliver painful losses. (The U.S. stock market fell 38% in 2008, 
for example.) Other investments are riskier still. For example, high-tech growth stocks 
offer the prospect of higher rates of return than typical stocks but are also more volatile 
than typical stocks.
Managers look to the financial markets to measure the opportunity cost of capital 
for the firm’s investment projects. They can observe the opportunity cost of capital for 
safe investments by looking up current interest rates on safe debt securities. For risky 
investments, the opportunity cost of capital has to be estimated. We start to tackle this 
task in Chapter 11.
1.5 Agency Problems, Executive Compensation, 
and Corporate Governance
Sole proprietors face no conflicts in financial management. They are both owners and 
managers, reaping the rewards of good decisions and hard work and suffering when 
they make bad decisions or slack off. Their personal wealth is tied to the value of their 
businesses.
In most large corporations, the owners are mostly outside investors, and so the 
managers may be tempted to act in their own interests rather than maximize shareholder value. For example, they may shy away from valuable but risky investment 
projects because they worry more about job security than maximizing value. They 
may build empires by overaggressive investment or overconfident acquisitions of 
other companies.
The temptation for such value-destroying actions arises because the managers are 
not the shareholders, but agents of the shareholders. Therefore, the actions are called 
agency problems. Losses in value from agency problems—or from costs incurred to 
mitigate the problems—are called agency costs.
Agency problems sometimes lead to outrageous behavior. When Dennis 
Kozlowski, the former CEO of Tyco, threw a $2 million birthday bash for his wife, 
he charged half the cost to the company. Conrad Black, the former boss of Hollinger 
International, used the company jet for a trip with his wife to Bora Bora. These, of 
course, are extreme examples. The agency problems encountered in the ordinary 
course of business are often subtle and mundane. But agency problems do arise 
whenever managers think just a little less hard about spending money that is not 
their own.

Investing $100,000 in additional raw materials, mostly palladium, should allow 
Cryogenic Concepts to increase production and earn an additional $112,000 
next year. This payoff could cover the investment, plus a 12% return. Palladium is 
traded in commodity markets. The CFO has studied the history of returns from 
investments in palladium and believes that investors in the precious metal 
can reasonably expect a 15% return. What is the opportunity cost of capital? 
Is Cryogenic’s proposed investment in palladium a good idea? Why or why not?

Think of the corporation’s value as a pie that is divided among several classes of 
claimants. These include managers and workers as well as shareholders and lenders. 
The government is a claimant, too, because it taxes sales and profits. The claimants are 
called stakeholders because each has a stake in the firm. Agency problems arise 
whenever the stakeholders’ interests do not coincide.
