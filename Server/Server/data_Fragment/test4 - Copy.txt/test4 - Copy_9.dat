usiness. With 
about $200 of his own money and a $1,500 loan, he was able 
to rent space in the old section of Sarajevo, and he began 
repairing and selling discarded industrial sewing machines. 
After just 8 years, Hujdur has 10 employees building, installing, 
and fixing this industrial machinery. Hujdur didn’t get his initial 
loan from a local bank. “They were asking for guarantees that 
were impossible to get,” he recalls. Instead, the capital came 
from LOKmicro, a local financial institution specializing in 
microfinance—the lending of small amounts to the poor in 
developing nations to help them launch small enterprises.
Microfinance institutions get capital from individual and 
institutional investors via microfinance funds, which collect 
the investors’ money, vet the local lenders, offer them management assistance, and administer investors’ accounts.

Cash retained and reinvested in the firm’s operations is cash saved and invested 
on behalf of the firm’s shareholders.
Of course, a small corporation has other financing choices. It could take out a bank 
loan, for example. The bank in turn may have raised money by attracting savings 
accounts. In this case, investors’ savings flow through the bank to the firm.
Now consider a large, public corporation, for example, Apple Computer in 
September 2015. What’s different? Scale, for one thing: Apple’s annual revenues for 
the previous 12 months were $234 billion, and its balance sheet showed total assets of 
$290 billion. The scope of Apple’s activities has also expanded: It now has dozens of 
product lines and operates worldwide. Because of this scale and scope, Apple attracts 
investors’ savings by a variety of different routes. It can do so because it is a large, 
profitable, public firm.
The flow of savings to large public corporations is shown in Figure 2.2. Notice two 
key differences from Figure 2.1. First, public corporations can draw savings from investors worldwide. Second, the savings flow through financial markets, financial intermediaries, or both. Suppose, for example, that Bank of America raises $900 million by a 
new issue of shares. An Italian investor buys 4,000 of the new shares for $15 per share. 
Now Bank of America takes that $60,000, along with money raised by the rest of the 
issue, and makes a $300 million loan to Apple. The Italian investor’s savings end up 
flowing through financial markets (the stock market), to a financial intermediary (Bank 
of America), and finally to Apple.
Of course, our Italian friend’s $60,000 doesn’t literally arrive at Apple in an envelope marked “From L. DaVinci.” Investments by the purchasers of the Bank of 
America’s stock issue are pooled, not segregated. Signor DaVinci would own a share 
of all of Bank of America’s assets, not just one loan to Apple. Nevertheless, investors’ 
savings are flowing through the financial markets and the bank to finance Apple’s 
capital investments.

corporation. Investors use 
savings to buy additional shares. 
Investors also save when the 
corporation reinvests on their 
behalf.
