The same goes for the right-hand side of the balance sheet. In the case of liabilities, 
the accountant simply records the amount of money that you have promised to pay. 
For short-term liabilities, this figure is generally close to the market value of that 
promise. For example, if you owe the bank $1 million tomorrow, the accounts show a 
book liability of $1 million. As long as you are not bankrupt, that $1 million is also 
roughly the value to the bank of your promise. But now suppose that $1 million is not 
due to be repaid for several years. The accounts still show a liability of $1 million, but 
how much your debt is worth depends on what happens to interest rates. If interest 
rates rise after you have issued the debt, lenders may not be prepared to pay as much 
as $1 million for your debt; if interest rates fall, they may be prepared to pay more than 
$1 million.4
 Thus the market value of a long-term liability may be higher or lower 
than the book value. Market values of assets and liabilities do not generally equal 
their book values. Book values are based on historical or original values. Market 
values measure current values of assets and liabilities.
The difference between book value and market value is likely to be greatest for 
shareholders’ equity. The book value of equity measures the cash that shareholders 
have contributed in the past plus the cash that the company has retained and reinvested 
in the business on their behalf. But this often bears little resemblance to the total market value that investors place on the shares.
If the market price of the firm’s shares falls through the floor, don’t try telling the 
shareholders that the book value is satisfactory—they won’t want to hear. Shareholders are concerned with the market value of their shares; market value, not book value, 
is the price at which they can sell their shares. Managers who wish to keep their shareholders happy will focus on market values.
We will often find it useful to think about the firm in terms of a market-value 
balance sheet. Like a conventional balance sheet, a market-value balance sheet lists 
the firm’s assets, but it records each asset at its current market value rather than at 
historical cost less depreciation. Similarly, each liability is shown at its market value. 
The difference between the market values of assets and liabilities is the market 
value of the shareholders’ equity claim. The stock price is simply the market 
value of shareholders’ equity divided by the number of outstanding shares.

 We will show you how changing interest rates affect the market value of debt in Chapter 6.

Market- versus Book-Value Balance Sheets
Jupiter has developed a revolutionary auto production process that enables it to produce 
cars 20% more efficiently than any rival. It has invested $10 billion in building its new plant. 
To finance the investment, Jupiter borrowed $4 billion and raised the remaining funds by 
selling new shares of stock in the firm. There are currently 100 million shares of stock 
outstanding. Investors are very excited about Jupiter’s prospects. They believe that the flow 
of profits from the new plant justifies a stock price of $75.
If these are Jupiter’s only assets, the book-value balance sheet immediately after it has 
made the investment is as follows:

 Jupiter has borrowed $4 billion to finance its investment, but if the interest rate has changed in the meantime, 
the debt could be worth more or less than $4 billion.

Shareholders’ equity 7.5
Investors are placing a market value on Jupiter’s equity of $7.5 billion ($75 per share 
times 100 million shares). We assume that the debt outstanding is worth $4 billion.5 Therefore, if you owned all Jupiter’s shares and all its debt, the value of your holdings would be 
$7.5 + $4 = $11.5 billion. In this case, you would own the company lock, stock, and barrel 
and would be entitled to all its cash flows. Because you can buy the entire company for 
$11.5 billion, the total value of Jupiter’s assets must also be $11.5 billion. In other words, the 
market value of the assets must be equal to the market value of the liabilities plus the market value of the shareholders’ equity.
We can now draw up the market-value balance sheet as follows:
Notice that the market value of Jupiter’s plant is $1.5 billion more than the plant cost to 
build. The difference is due to the superior profits that investors expect the plant to earn. 
Thus, in contrast to the balance sheet shown in the company’s books, the market-value 
balance sheet is forward-looking. It depends on the profits that investors expect the 
assets to provide. ■
Is it surprising that market value generally exceeds book value? It shouldn’t be. Firms 
find it attractive to raise money to invest in various projects because they believe the 
projects will be worth more than they cost. Otherwise, why bother? You will usually 
find that shares of stock sell for more than the value shown in the company’s books.
The Income Statement
If Home Depot’s balance sheet resembles a snapshot of the firm at a particular time, its 
income statement is like a video. It shows how profitable the firm has been during the 
past year.
Look at the summary income statement in Table 3.3. You can see that during fiscal 
2014, Home Depot sold goods worth $83,176 million and that the total cost of acquiring and selling those goods was $54,222 + $16,699 = $70,921 million. The largest 
expense item, amounting to $54,222 million, consisted of the cost of goods sold. This 
included the acquisition cost of Home Depot’s goods, the wages of its employees, and 
the other expenses incurred to obtain and sell its wares. Almost all the remaining

expenses were administrative expenses such as head office costs, advertising, and 
distribution.
In addition to these out-of-pocket expenses, Home Depot also made a deduction 
for the value of the plant and equipment used up in producing the goods. In 2014, 
this charge for depreciation was $1,786 million. Thus Home Depot’s earnings before 
interest and taxes (EBIT) were
EBIT = total revenues + other income − costs − depreciation
= 83, 176 + 337 − (54,222 + 16,699) − 1, 786 
= $10, 806 million
The remainder of the income statement shows where these earnings went. As we 
saw earlier, Home Depot has partly financed its investment in plant and equipment by 
borrowing. In 2014, it paid $830 million of interest on this borrowing. A further slice 
of the profit went to the government in the form of taxes. This amounted to $3,631 
million. The $6,345 million that was left over after paying interest and taxes belonged 
to the shareholders. Of this sum, Home Depot paid out $2,530 million in dividends 
and reinvested the remaining $3,815 million in the business. Presumably, these reinvested funds made the company more valuable.
The $3,815 of earnings that Home Depot retained and reinvested in the firm show 
up on its balance sheet as an increase in retained earnings. Notice that retained earnings in Table 3.1 increased by $3,815 million in 2014, from $23,180 million to $26,995 
million. However, shareholders’ equity fell during the year because Home Depot also 
repurchased some of its stock.
Just as it is sometimes useful to prepare a common-size balance sheet, we can also 
prepare a common-size income statement. In this case, all items are expressed as a 
percentage of revenues. The last column of Table 3.3 is Home Depot’s common-size 
income statement. You can see, for example, that the cost of goods sold consumed 
65.2% of revenues and that selling, general, and administrative expenses absorbed a 
further 20.1%.
Income versus Cash Flow
It is important to distinguish between Home Depot’s income and the cash that the 
company generated. Here are two reasons that income and cash are not the same:
1. Depreciation. When Home Depot’s accountants prepare the income statement, they 
do not simply count the cash coming in and the cash going out. Instead, the 
accountant starts with the cash payments but then divides these payments into two
