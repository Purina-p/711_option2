corporation, in this example, for at least 3 years.
Agency problems are controlled in practice in three ways. First, corporations set up 
internal controls and decision-making procedures to prevent wasteful spending and 
discourage careless investment. We discuss the controls and procedures in several later 
chapters. For example, Chapters 8, 9, and 10 cover procedures for disciplined, valuemaximizing capital investment decisions. Second, corporations try to design compensation schemes that align managers’ and shareholders’ interests. Third, the corporations 
are constrained by corporate governance. We comment on compensation and governance here.
Executive Compensation
The compensation packages of top executives are almost always tied to the financial 
performance of their companies. The package typically includes a fixed base salary 
plus an annual award tied to earnings or other measures of financial performance. 
The more senior the manager, the smaller the base salary as a fraction of total compensation. Also, compensation is not all in cash, but partly in shares. The shares are 
usually restricted stock, which the manager is required to hold onto while employed 
by the corporation.8
 Many corporations also include stock options in compensation 
packages. Stock options, which we cover in Chapter 23, give especially powerful 
incentives to maximize stock price per share.
The upside compensation potential for a few top managers is enormous. For example, Larry Ellison, CEO of the business software giant Oracle, received total compensation of $64 million for 2015. Only $1 of that amount was base salary. The rest came 
from grants of stock and options. The options will be worthless if Oracle’s stock price 
falls from its 2015 level but will pay off handsomely if the price rises. In addition, as a 
founder of Oracle, Ellison owns shares worth $49 billion. No one can say for certain 
how hard Ellison would have worked with a different compensation package, but one 
thing is clear: He has a huge personal stake in Oracle’s market value.
Well-designed compensation schemes alleviate agency problems by encouraging 
managers to maximize shareholder wealth. But some schemes are not well designed; 
they reward managers even when value is destroyed. For example, during Robert 
Nardelli’s 6-year tenure as CEO, Home Depot’s stock price fell by 20% while shares of 
its rival Lowe’s nearly doubled. When Nardelli was ousted in January 2007, he received 
a farewell package worth $210 million. Needless to say, many shareholders were livid.
In 2010, the Dodd-Frank financial reform law gave U.S. shareholders the right to 
express their opinion on executive compensation through nonbinding “say on pay” 
votes at 1- or 3-year intervals. (Shareholders of U.K. companies have a similar right.) 
What are agency problems and agency costs? Give two or three examples of 
decisions by managers that can lead to agency costs.

 A large block of shares may give effective control even when there is no majority owner. For example, Larry 
Ellison’s billion-plus shares give him a 25% stake in Oracle. Barring some extreme catastrophe, this holding 
means that he can run the company as long as he wants to.
Most votes have endorsed compensation policy, but occasionally shareholders refuse. 
For example, in 2011 Hewlett-Packard’s shareholders voted against a $40 million compensation package for its new CEO. When there is a “no” vote, the company generally 
changes the pay package to make it less generous; other companies look anxiously over 
their shoulders to check that their compensation package is not next in the spotlight.
Corporate Governance
Financial markets and institutions are supposed to direct financing to firms that can 
invest to add value. But financing moves from investors to firms only if investors are 
protected and if agency problems within firms are absent or at least tolerable. Thus 
there is a need for a system of corporate governance so that money can flow to the 
right firms at the right times. “Corporate governance” refers to the laws, regulations, 
institutions, and corporate practices that protect shareholders and other investors. 
When scandals happen, we say that corporate governance has broken down. When 
corporations compete to deliver value to shareholders, we are comforted that corporate 
governance is working properly.
Good corporate governance relies in part on well-designed management compensation packages. Other elements of good corporate governance include the following.
Legal Requirements Good governance requires laws and regulations that protect 
investors from self-dealing by insiders. CEOs and financial managers have a fiduciary 
duty to stockholders. That is, they are required to act fairly and responsibly in the 
stockholders’ interests. If they don’t, they may end up in jail like Tyco’s Dennis 
Kozlowski and Hollinger’s Conrad Black.
Boards of Directors The board of directors appoints top managers, including the 
CEO and CFO, and must approve important financial decisions. For example, only 
the board has legal authority to approve a dividend or a public issue of securities. The 
board approves compensation schemes and awards to top management. Boards usually 
delegate decision making for small and medium-size investments, but the authority to 
approve large investments is almost never delegated.
The board of directors is elected by shareholders and is supposed to represent their 
interests. Boards have been portrayed as passive supporters of top management, but 
the balance has tipped toward independence. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) 
requires that more directors be independent—that is, not affiliated with management. 
The majority of directors are now independent. Boards must also meet in executive 
sessions with the CEO not present. SOX also requires CEOs and CFOs to sign off 
personally on the
