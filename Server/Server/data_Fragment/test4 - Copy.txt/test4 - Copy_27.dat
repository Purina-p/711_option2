inventories. Following an 
investigation by the SEC, the company agreed to pay $150 million to settle 
accusations that this channel stuffing had improperly inflated its sales and earnings. 
In Chapter 1, we mentioned Hewlett-Packard’s disastrous acquisition of the British 
company Autonomy. Hewlett-Packard paid $11.1 billion for Autonomy. Just over a 
year later, it wrote down the value of the company by $8.8 billion, alleging that 
Autonomy had used channel stuffing to greatly inflate its revenues.
∙ Cookie-jar reserves. The giant mortgage-pass-through firm Freddie Mac earned the 
Wall Street nickname “Steady Freddie” for its unusually smooth and predictable 
pattern of earnings growth, at least until 2008 when it suddenly collapsed in the 
wake of the meltdown in subprime mortgages. Unfortunately, it emerged in 2003 
that Freddie achieved this predictability in part by misusing its reserve accounts. 
Normally, such accounts are intended to allow for the likely impact of events 
that might reduce earnings, such as the failure of customers to pay their bills. 
But Freddie seemed to “overreserve” against such contingencies so that it could 
“release” those reserves and bolster income in a bad year. Its steady growth was 
largely a matter of earnings management.
∙ Off–balance sheet assets and liabilities. Before its bankruptcy in 2001 (at that time, 
the second largest in U.S. history), Enron had accumulated large debts and had also 
guaranteed the debts of other companies in which it had an ownership stake. 
To present a fair view of the firm, Enron should have recognized these potential 
liabilities on its balance sheet. But the firm created and placed paper firms—
so-called special-purpose entities (SPEs)—in the middle of its transactions and 
excluded these liabilities from its financial statements.
The collapse of Enron illustrates how dishonest managers with creamy compensation packages may be tempted to conceal the truth from investors. If the company had 
been more transparent to outsiders—that is, if they could have assessed its true profitability and prospects—its problems would have shown up right away in a falling stock 
price. This in turn would have generated extra scrutiny from security analysts, bond 
rating agencies, lenders, and investors.

With transparency, corporate troubles generally lead to corrective action. But the 
top management of a troubled and opaque company may be able to maintain its stock 
price and postpone the discipline of the market. Market discipline caught up with 
Enron only a month or two before bankruptcy.
Enron was not the only company to be mired in accounting scandals in the early 
years of the century. Firms such as Global Crossing, Qwest Communications, and 
WorldCom misstated profits by billions of dollars. Overseas, the Italian dairy company Parmalat falsified the existence of a bank account to the tune of $5.5 billion, and 
the French media and entertainment company Vivendi came close to bankruptcy after 
it was accused of accounting fraud. In response to these scandals, Congress passed the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, widely known as SOX. A major goal of SOX is to increase transparency and ensure that companies and their accountants provide directors, lenders, 
and shareholders with the information they need to monitor progress.
SOX created the Public Accounting Oversight Board to oversee the auditing of 
public companies; it banned accounting firms from offering other services to companies whose accounts they audit; it prohibited any individual from heading a firm’s 
audit for more than 5 years; and it required that the board’s audit committee consist of 
directors who are independent of the company’s management. Sarbanes-Oxley also 
required that management certify that the financial statements present a fair view of 
the firm’s financial position and demonstrate that the firm has adequate controls and 
procedures for financial reporting. All this has come at a price. Managers and investors worry that the costs of SOX and the burden of meeting detailed, inflexible regulations are pushing some corporations to return from public to private ownership. 
Some blame SOX and onerous regulation in the United States for the fact that an 
increasing number of foreign companies have chosen to list their shares in London 
rather than New York.
There is also a vigorous debate over “rules-based” versus “principles-based” 
approaches to accounting standards. The United States follows a rules-based approach, 
companies must be ready to defend their accounting practices in light of the general principles laid out in the IFRS. 
By contrast, in the United States, GAAP are accompanied by 
thousands of pages of prescriptive regulatory guidance 
and interpretations from auditors and accounting groups. 
For example, more than 160 pieces of authoritative literature 
relate to how and when companies record revenue. This 
leaves less room for judgment, but detailed rules rapidly 
become out of date, and unscrupulous companies have been 
able to structure transactions so that they keep to the letter 
but not the spirit of the rules.
By 2014, it had become clear that the SEC’s plan to move 
to IFRS was effectively dead and that, while the SEC and IASB 
would continue to collaborate on accounting rules, there was 
little prospect of any agreement over a single global standard 
that included the United States.
The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which 
are set by the London-based International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB), aim to harmonize financial reporting 
around the world. They are the basis for reporting throughout 
the European Union. In addition, some 100 other countries, 
such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, India, and China, have 
adopted them or plan to do so.
For some years, the SEC has worked to bring U.S. accounting standards more in line with international rules. For example, until 2007 foreign companies that traded on U.S. stock 
exchanges were required to show how their accounts differed from U.S. GAAP. This was a very expensive exercise 
that cost some companies millions of dollars annually and 
caused many to delist their stocks. These companies can 
now simply report results using international accounting standards. Subsequently, in August 2008, the SEC released its 
plans to allow some large U.S. multinationals, representing 
approximately $2.5 trillion in market capitalization, to eventually use IFRS for financial statements.
This shift from GAAP to IFRS would involve a major change 
in the way that accountants in the United States approach 
their task. IFRS tend to be “principles-based,” which means 
that there are no hard-and-fast codes to follow. Instead,

with detailed rules governing virtually every circumstance that possibly can be anticipated. In contrast, the European Union takes a principles-based approach to accounting. Its International Financial Reporting Standards set out general approaches that 
financial statements should take to valuing assets. Europe and the United States have 
been engaged for years in attempts to coordinate their systems, and many in the United 
States have lobbied for the greater simplicity that principles-based accounting 
standards might offer. The nearby box reports on these efforts.
Taxes
Taxes often have a major effect on financial decisions. Therefore, we should explain 
how corporations and investors are taxed.
Corporate Tax
Companies pay tax on their income. Table 3.5 shows that there are special low rates of 
corporate tax for small companies, but for large companies (those with income over 
$18.33 million) the corporate tax rate is 35%.12 Thus for every $100 that the firm earns 
it pays $35 in corporate tax.
When firms calculate taxable income, they are allowed to deduct expenses. These 
expenses include an allowance for depreciation. However, the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) specifies the rates of depreciation that the company can use for different 
types of equipment. The rates of depreciation used to calculate taxes are not the same 
as the rates used when the firm reports its profits to shareholders.13
The company is also allowed to deduct interest paid to debtholders when calculating its taxable income, but dividends paid to shareholders are not deductible. These 
dividends are therefore paid out of after-tax income. Table 3.6 provides an example of 
how interest payments reduce corporate taxes. Although EBIT for both firms A and B

Tax (35% of pretax income) 21 35
Net income $ 39 $ 65
TABLE 3.6 Firms A and B both 
have earnings before interest 
and taxes (EBIT) of $100 million, 
but A pays out part of its profits 
as debt interest. This reduces the 
corporate tax paid by A.
Note: Figures in millions of dollars.
12 In addition, corporations pay state income taxes, which we ignore here for simplicity.
13 If the company assumes a slower rate of depreciation in its income statement than the Internal Revenue 
Service assumes, the tax charge shown in the income statement will be higher in the early years of a project’s 
life than the actual tax payment. This difference is recorded in the balance sheet as a liability for deferred tax. 
We will tell you more about depreciation allowances in Chapter 9.

is $100 million, firm A, which has $40 million of interest expense, has lower pretax 
income and therefore pays less taxes.
The bad news about taxes is that each extra dollar of revenue increases taxable 
income by $1 and results in 35 cents of extra taxes. The good news is that each extra 
dollar of expense reduces taxable income by $1 and therefore reduces taxes by 
35 cents. For example, if the firm borrows money, every dollar of interest it pays on 
the loan reduces taxes by 35 cents. Therefore, a dollar of interest reduces after-tax 
income by only 65 cents.
14 Losses can be carried back for a maximum of 3 years and forward for up to 15 years.

When firms make profits, they pay 35% of the profits to the Internal Revenue 
Service. But the process doesn’t work in reverse; if the firm suffers a loss, the IRS does 
not send it a check for 35% of the loss. However, the f
