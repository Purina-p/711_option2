ty cost of capital in this case? Is the 
purchase of additional sequesters a worthwhile capital investment?
25. Goals of the Firm. It is sometimes suggested that instead of seeking to maximize shareholder 
value and, in the process, pursuing profit, the firm should seek to maximize the welfare of all its 
stakeholders, such as its employees, its customers, and the community in which it operates. 
How far would this objective conflict with one of maximizing shareholder value? Do you think 
such an objective is feasible or desirable? (LO1-5)
26. Agency Issues. Many firms have devised defenses that make it much more costly or difficult for 
other firms to take them over. How might such takeover defenses affect the firm’s agency problems? Are managers of firms with formidable takeover defenses more or less likely to act in the 
firm’s interest rather than their own? (LO1-6)
27. Agency Issues. Sometimes lawyers work on a contingency basis. They collect a percentage of 
their clients’ settlements instead of receiving fixed fees. Why might clients prefer this arrangement? Would the arrangement mitigate an agency problem? Explain. (LO1-6)
28. Agency Issues. One of the “Finance through the Ages” episodes that we cited is the 1993 
collapse of Barings Bank, when one of its traders lost $1.3 billion. Traders are compensated in 
large part according to their trading profits. How might this practice have contributed to an 
agency problem? (LO1-6)
29. Agency Issues. When a company’s stock is widely held, it may not pay an individual shareholder to spend time monitoring managers’ performance and trying to replace poor performers. 
Explain why. Do you think that a bank that has made a large loan to the company is in a different 
position? (LO1-6)
30. Agency Issues. Company A pays its managers a fixed salary. Company B ties compensation to 
the performance of the stock. Which company’s compensation package would most effectively 
mitigate conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders? (LO1-6)
31. Corporate Governance. How do clear and comprehensive financial reports promote effective 
corporate governance? (LO1-6)
32. Corporate Governance. Some commentators have claimed that the U.S. system of corporate 
governance is “broken” and needs thorough reform. What do you think? Do you see systematic 
failures in corporate governance or just a few “bad apples”? (LO1-6)
33. Agency Issues. Which of the following forms of compensation is most likely to align the interests of managers and shareholders? (LO1-6)
a. A fixed salary
b. A salary linked to company profits
c. A salary that is paid partly in the form of the company’s shares
34. Agency Costs. What are agency costs? List some ways by which agency costs are mitigated. 
(LO1-6)
35. Reputation. As you drive down a deserted highway, you are overcome with a sudden desire for 
a hamburger. Fortunately, just ahead are two hamburger outlets; one is owned by a national 
brand, and the other appears to be owned by “Joe.” Which outlet has the greater incentive to 
serve you cat meat? Why? (LO1-7)
36. Ethics. In some countries, such as Japan and Germany, corporations develop close long-term relationships with one bank and rely on that bank for a large part of their financing needs. In the United 
States, companies are more likely to shop around for the best deal. Do you think that this practice 
is more or less likely to encourage ethical behavior on the part of the corporation? (LO1-7)
37. Ethics. Is there a conflict between “doing well” and “doing good”? In other words, are policies 
that increase the value of the firm (doing well) necessarily at odds with socially responsible 
policies (doing good)? When there are conflicts, how might government regulations or laws tilt 
the firm toward doing good? For example, how do taxes or fees charged on pollutants affect the 
firm’s decision to pollute? Can you cite other examples of “incentives” used by governments to 
align private interests with public ones? (LO1-7)
38. Ethics. Look at some of the practices described in the Finance in Practice box on ethic disputes 
in finance. What, if any, do you believe are the ethical issues involved? (LO1-7)

SOLUTIONS TO SELF-TEST QUESTIONS
1.1 a. The development of a microprocessor is a capital budgeting decision. The investment of 
$1 billion will purchase a real asset, the microprocessor design and production facilities.
b. The bank loan is a financing decision. This is how BMW will raise money for its 
investment.
c. Capital budgeting.
d. Capital budgeting. The marketing campaign should generate a real, though intangible, 
asset.
e. Both. The acquisition is an investment decision. The decision to issue shares is a financing 
decision.
1.2 a. A real asset. Real assets can be intangible assets.
b. Financial.
c. Real.
d. Financial.
e. Real.
f. Financial.
1.3 Fritz would more likely be the treasurer and Frieda the controller. The treasurer raises money 
from the financial markets and requires a background in financial institutions. The controller 
requires a background in accounting.
1.4 There is no reason for the Hotspurs to avoid high-dividend stocks, even if they wish to invest 
for tuition bills in the distant future. Their concern should be only with the risk and expected 
return of the shares. If a particular stock pays a generous cash dividend, they always have 
the option of reinvesting the dividend in that stock or, for that matter, in other securities. 
The dividend payout does not affect their ability to redirect current investment income to 
their future needs as they plan for their anticipated tuition bills.
1.5 Because investors can reasonably expect a 15% return in other investments in palladium, 
the firm should take this as the opportunity cost of capital for its proposed investment. 
Although the project is expected to show an accounting profit, its expected return is only 12%. 
Therefore, the firm should reject the project: Its expected return is less than the 15% expected 
return offered by equivalent-risk investments.
1.6 Agency problems arise when managers and shareholders have different objectives. Managers 
may empire-build with excessive investment and growth. Managers may be unduly riskaverse, or they may try to take excessive salaries or perquisites.
1.7 Harry’s has a far bigger stake in the reputation of its business than Victor’s. The store has been 
in business for a long time. The owners have spent years establishing customer loyalty. 
In contrast, Victor’s has just been established. The owner has little of his own money tied up 
in the firm, and so has little to lose if the business fails. In addition, the nature of the business 
results in little customer loyalty. Harry’s is probably more reliable.

f a corporation needs to issue more shares of stock, 
then its financial manager had better understand how 
the stock market works. If it wants to take out a bank 
loan, the financial manager had better understand how 
banks and other financial institutions work. If the firm 
contemplates a capital investment, such as a factory 
expansion or a new product launch, the financial manager needs to think clearly about the cost of the capital 
that the firm raises from outside investors. As we pointed 
out in Chapter 1, the opportunity cost of capital for the 
firm is the rate of return that its stockholders expect to 
get by investing on their own in financial markets. This 
means that the financial manager must understand how 
prices are determined in the financial markets in order 
to make wise investment decisions.
Financial markets and institutions are the firm’s financial environment. You don’t have to know everything 
about that environment to begin the study of financial 
management, but a general understanding provides 
useful context for the work ahead. For example, it will 
help you to understand why you are calculating the 
yield to maturity of a bond in Chapter 6, the net present 
value of a capital investment in Chapter 9, or the 
weighted-average cost of capital for a company in 
Chapter 13.
This chapter does three things. First, it surveys financial markets and institutions. We will cover the stock and 
bond markets, banks and insurance companies, and 
mutual and pension funds. Second, we will set out the 
functions of financial markets and institutions and look 
at how they help corporations and the economy. Third, 
we will discuss the financial crisis of 2007–2009 and 
the eurozone crisis that followed. An understanding of 
what happens when financial markets do not function 
well is important for understanding why and how financial markets and institutions matter.

The Importance of Financial Markets 
and Institutions
In the previous chapter, we explained why corporations need to be good at finance in 
order to survive and prosper. All corporations face important investment and financing 
decisions. But, of course, those decisions are not made in a vacuum. They are made in 
a financial environment. That environment has two main segments: financial markets 
and financial institutions.
Businesses have to go to financial markets and institutions for the financing they 
need to grow. When they have a surplus of cash, and no need for immediate financing, 
they have to invest the cash, for example, in bank accounts or in securities. Let’s take 
Apple Computer Inc. as an example.
Table 2.1 presents a time line for Apple and examples of the sources of financing 
tapped by Apple from its start-up in a California garage in 1976 to its cash-rich status 
in 2016. The initial investment in Apple stock was $250,000. Apple was also able to 
get short-term financing from parts suppliers who did not demand immediate payment. 
Apple got the parts, assembled and sold the computers, and afterward paid off its 
accounts payable to the suppliers. (We discuss accounts payable in Chapter 19.) Then,
