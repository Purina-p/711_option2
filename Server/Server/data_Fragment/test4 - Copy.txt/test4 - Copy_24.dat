groups—current expenditures (such as wages) and capital expenditures (such as the 
purchase of new machinery). Current expenditures are deducted from current 
profits. However, rather than deducting the cost of long-lived machinery in the year 
it is purchased, the accountant spreads its acquisition cost over its forecasted life by 
making an annual charge for depreciation.
Thus, when calculating profits, the accountant does not deduct the expenditure 
on new equipment that year, even though cash is paid out. However, the accountant 
does deduct depreciation on assets previously purchased, even though no cash is 
currently paid out. For example, suppose a $100,000 investment is depreciated by 
$10,000 a year for 10 years.6
 This depreciation is treated as an annual expense, 
although the cash actually went out of the door when the asset was first purchased. 
For this reason, the deduction for depreciation is classified as a noncash expense.
To calculate the cash produced by the business, it is necessary to add the 
depreciation charge (which is not a cash payment) back to accounting profits 
and to subtract the expenditure on new capital equipment (which is a cash 
payment).
2. Cash versus accrual accounting. Consider a manufacturer that spends $60 to 
produce goods in period 1. In period 2 it sells these goods for $100, but its customers 
pay their bills with a delay, so payment is not received until period 3. The following 
diagram shows the firm’s cash flows. In period 1 there is a cash outflow of $60. 
Then, when customers pay their bills in period 3, there is an inflow of $100.
+$100 (collect payment)
-$60 (pay for goods)

 We discuss depreciation rules in Chapter 9.
It would be misleading to say that the firm was running at a loss in period 1 
(when cash flow was negative) or that it was extremely profitable in period 3 (when 
cash flow was positive). Therefore, to construct the income statement, the 
accountant looks at when the sale was made (period 2 in our example) and gathers 
together all the revenues and expenses associated with that sale. For our company,
