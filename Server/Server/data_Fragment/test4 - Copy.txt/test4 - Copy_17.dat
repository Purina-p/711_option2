the market for MBSs. That meant that potential buyers of the illiquid assets could not know for sure what they were worth. Thus, the informational function of financial markets was also compromised.
Second, why were Bear Stearns, Lehman, Merrill Lynch, and the other distressed 
firms so fragile? One reason is that they were mostly financed with borrowed money, 
much of it short-term debt that had to be refinanced frequently. Investment banks like 
Lehman typically were financed with more than 95% debt and less than 5% equity 
capital. Thus a 5% fall in their asset values could wipe out their equity “cushions” and 
leave the banks insolvent. Regulators since the crisis have therefore required banks to 
finance with much more equity. This requirement has also affected payout to shareholders. A U.S. bank’s dividend payments can be stopped by regulators if the bank’s 
equity capital ratio is not up to snuff. We cover decisions about debt versus equity 
financing and payout in Chapters 16 and 17.
Third, some causes of the crisis can be traced back to agency problems noted in 
Chapter 1. Managers in the mortgage business were probably at least dimly aware that 
promoting and selling massive amounts of subprime MBSs was likely to end badly. 
They didn’t wake up in the morning thinking, “Hey, maybe I can cause a financial 
crisis,” but their incentives did call for trying to squeeze out one more fat bonus before 
the game ended. Their incentives were not aligned with shareholders’. The value of 
their firms suffered accordingly.
SUMMARY
The ultimate source of financing is individuals’ savings. The savings may flow through 
financial markets and intermediaries. The intermediaries include mutual funds, pension 
funds, and financial institutions, such as
