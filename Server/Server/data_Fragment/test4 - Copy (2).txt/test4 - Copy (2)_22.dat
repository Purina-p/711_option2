The Stock Market
A financial market is a market where securities are issued and traded. A security is 
just a traded financial asset, such as a share of stock. For a corporation, the stock market is probably the most important financial market.
As corporations grow, their requirements for outside capital can expand dramatically. At some point the firm will decide to “go public” by issuing shares on an organized exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ; that first 
issue is called an initial public offering or IPO. The buyers of the IPO are helping to 
finance the firm’s investment in real assets. In return, the buyers become part-owners 
of the firm and participate in its future success or failure. (Most investors in the Internet IPOs of 1999 and 2000 are by now sorely disappointed, but many IPOs pay off 
handsomely. If only we had bought Apple shares on their IPO day in 1980 . . .) Of 
course a corporation’s IPO is not its last chance to issue shares. For example, Bank of 
America went public in the 1930s, but it could make a new issue of shares tomorrow.
A new issue of shares increases both the amount of cash held by the company and 
the number of shares held by the public. Such an issue is known as a primary issue,
and it is sold in the primary market. But in addition to helping companies raise new 
cash, financial markets also allow investors to trade securities among themselves. For 
example, Smith might decide to raise some cash by selling her Apple stock at the same 
time that Jones invests his spare cash in Apple. The result is simply a transfer of ownership from Smith to Jones, which has no effect on the company itself. Such purchases 
and sales of existing securities are known as secondary transactions, and they take 
place in the secondary market. Notice that Smith and Jones might be less happy for 
Apple to raise new capital and invest in
