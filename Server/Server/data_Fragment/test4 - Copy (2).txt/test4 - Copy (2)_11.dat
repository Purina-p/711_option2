 adjustments and job losses. Some 
stakeholders lose. But shareholders and the overall economy 
can gain if businesses are managed more efficiently.
Tax Avoidance
In 2012 it was revealed that during the 14 years that Starbucks 
had operated in the United Kingdom, it paid hardly any taxes. 
Public outrage led to a boycott of Starbucks shops, and the 
company responded by promising that it would voluntarily 
pay to the taxman about $16 million more than it was required 
to pay by law. Several months later, a U.S. Senate committee 
investigating tax avoidance by U.S. technology firms reported 
that Apple had used a “highly questionable” web of offshore 
entities to avoid billions of dollars of U.S. taxes.
Multinational companies, such as Starbucks and Apple, 
could reduce their tax bills using legal techniques with exotic 
names such as the “Dutch Sandwich,” “Double Irish,” and 
“Check-the-Box.” But the public outcry over the revelations 
suggested that many believed that use of these techniques, 
though legal, was unethical. If they were unethical, that leaves 
an awkward question: How do companies decide which tax 
schemes are ethical and which are not? Can a company act in 
shareholders’ interest if it voluntarily pays more taxes than it 
is legally obligated to pay?
*We need not go into the mechanics of short sales here, but note that the seller 
is obligated to buy back the security, even if its price skyrockets far above what 
he or she sold it for. As the saying goes, “He who sells what isn’t his’n, buys it 
back or goes to prison.”
†The story of Paulson’s trade is told in G. Zuckerman, The Greatest Trade Ever 
(Broadway Business, 2009). The trade was controversial for reasons beyond 
short-selling. Scan the nearby Beyond the Page icon “Goldman Sachs causes a

Short-Selling
Investors who take short positions are betting that securities 
will fall in price. Usually they do this by borrowing the security, 
selling it for cash, and then waiting in the hope that they will 
be able to buy it back cheaply.* In 2007, hedge fund manager 
John Paulson took a huge short position in mortgage-backed 
securities. The bet paid off, and that year Paulson’s trade 
made a profit of $1 billion for his fund.†
Was Paulson’s trade unethical? Some believe not only that 
he was profiting from the misery that resulted from the crash 
in mortgage-backed securities, but that his short trades 
accentuated the collapse. It is certainly true that short-sellers 
have never been popular. For example, following the crash of 
1929, one commentator compared short-selling to the ghoulishness of “creatures who, at all great earthquakes and fires, 
spring up to rob broken homes and injured and dead 
humans.”
Short-selling in the stock market is the Wall Street Walk on 
steroids. Not only do short-sellers sell all the shares they may 
have previously owned, but they borrow more shares and sell 
them too, hoping to buy them back for less when the stock 
price falls. Poorly performing companies are natural targets 
for short-sellers, and the companies’ incumbent managers 
naturally complain, often bitterly. Governments sometimes 
listen to such complaints. For example, in 2008 the U.S. 
government temporarily banned short sales of financial 
stocks in an attempt to halt their decline.
But defendants of short-selling argue that selling securities that one believes are overpriced is no less legitimate 
than buying those that appear underpriced. The object of a 
well-functioning market is to set the correct stock prices, not 
always higher prices. Why impede short-selling if it conveys 
truly bad news, puts
