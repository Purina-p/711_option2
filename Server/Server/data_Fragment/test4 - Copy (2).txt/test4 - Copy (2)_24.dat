changes, but 
most corporate debt securities are traded over the counter, through a network of banks 
and securities dealers. Government debt is also traded over the counter.
A bond is a more complex security than a share of stock. A share is just a proportional ownership claim on the firm, with no definite maturity. Bonds and other debt 
securities can vary in maturity, in the degree of protection or collateral offered by the 
issuer, and in the level and timing of interest payments. Some bonds make “floating” 
interest payments tied to the future level of interest rates. Many can be “called” (repurchased and retired) by the issuing company before the bonds’ stated maturity date. 
Some bonds can be converted into other securities, usually the stock of the issuing 
company. You don’t need to master these distinctions now; just be aware that the debt 
or fixed-income market is a complicated and challenging place. A corporation must 
not only decide between debt and equity finance. It must also consider the design of 
debt. We return to the trading and pricing of debt securities in Chapter 6.
The markets for long-term debt and equity are called capital markets. A firm’s 
capital is its long-run financing. Short-term securities are traded in the money 
markets. “Short term” means less than 1 year. For example, large, creditworthy 
corporations raise short-term financing by issues of commercial paper, which are 
debt issues with maturities of no more than 270 days. Commercial paper is issued in 
the money market.
