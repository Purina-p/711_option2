The bank provides debt financing for the company and, at the same time, provides 
a place for depositors to park their money safely and withdraw it as needed.
Investment Banks We have discussed commercial banks, which raise money from 
depositors and other investors and then make loans to businesses and individuals. 
Investment banks are different. Investment banks do not generally take deposits or 
make loans to companies.10 Instead, they advise and assist companies in obtaining 
finance. For example, investment banks underwrite stock offerings by purchasing the 
new shares from the issuing company at a negotiated price and reselling the shares to 
investors. Thus the issuing company gets a fixed price for the new shares, and the 
investment bank takes responsibility for distributing the shares to investors. We discuss share issues in more detail in Chapter 15.
Investment banks also advise on takeovers, mergers, and acquisitions. They offer 
investment advice and manage investment portfolios for individual and institutional 
investors. They run trading desks for foreign exchange, commodities, bonds, options, 
and other derivatives.
Investment banks can invest their own money in start-ups and other ventures. 
For example, the Australian Macquarie Bank has invested in airports, toll highways, electric transmission and generation, and other infrastructure projects around 
the world.

The largest investment banks are financial powerhouses. They include Goldman 
Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lazard, Nomura (Japan), and Macquarie Bank.11 In addition, 
the major commercial banks, including Bank of America and Citigroup, all have 
investment banking operations.12
Insurance Companies Insurance companies are more important than banks for 
the long-term financing of business. They are massive investors in corporate stocks 
and bonds, and they often make long-term loans directly to corporations.
Suppose a company needs a loan of $2.5 million for 9 years, not 9 months. It could 
issue a bond directly to investors, or it could negotiate a 9-year loan with an insurance 
company:
11 The distinction between investment and commercial banks is not a legal one. Since 2008 both Goldman Sachs 
and Morgan Stanley have held banking licenses and are supervised by the Federal Reserve. However, they are 
not in the business of taking retail deposits or providing loans.
12 Bank of America owns Merrill Lynch, one of the largest investment banks. Merrill was rescued by Bank of 
America in 2009 after making huge losses from mortgage-related investments.
Company Insurance company
(Institution) Issues debt
$2.5 million
Investors
(Policyholders) Sells policies
$2.5 million
The money to make the loan comes mainly from the sale of insurance policies. Say 
you buy a fire insurance policy on your home. You pay cash to the insurance company 
and get a financial asset (the policy) in exchange. You receive no interest payments on 
this financial asset, but if a fire does strike, the company is obliged to cover the damages up to the policy limit. This is the return on your investment. (Of course, a fire is a 
sad and dangerous event that you hope to avoid. But if a fire does occur, you are better 
off getting a payoff on your insurance policy than not having insurance at all.)
The company will issue not just one policy but thousands. Normally the incidence 
of fires “averages out,” leaving the company with a predictable obligation to its policyholders as a group. Of course, the insurance company must charge enough for its policies to cover selling and administrative costs, pay policyholders’ claims, and generate 
a profit for its stockholders.

The pie chart in Figure 2.3 shows the investors in bonds and other debt securities. 
Notice the importance of institutional investors—mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and banks. Households (individual investors) hold less than 5% of the 
debt pie. The other slices represent the rest of the world (investors from outside the 
United States) and other, smaller categories of investors.
