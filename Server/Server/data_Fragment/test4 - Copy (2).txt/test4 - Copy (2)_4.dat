is best known today as the founder of FedEx. But in 1965 he was still a 
sophomore at Yale, where he wrote an economics term paper arguing that delivery 
systems were not keeping up with increasing needs for speed and dependability.1
He later joined his stepfather at a struggling equipment and maintenance firm for air 
carriers. He observed firsthand the difficulties of shipping spare parts on short notice. 
He saw the need for an integrated air and ground delivery system with a central hub 
that could connect a large number of points more efficiently than a point-to-point 
delivery system. In 1971, at the age of 27, Smith founded Federal Express.
Like many start-up firms, Federal Express flirted again and again with failure. 
Smith and his family had an inheritance of a few million dollars, but this was far from 
enough. The young company needed to purchase and retrofit a small fleet of aging 
Dassault Falcon jets; build a central-hub facility; and hire and train pilots, delivery, 
and office staff. The initial source of capital was short-term bank loans. Because of the 
company’s shaky financial position, the bank demanded that the planes be used as 
collateral and that Smith personally guarantee the loan with his own money.
In April 1973, the company went live with a fleet of 14 jets, servicing 25 U.S. cities 
out of its Memphis hub. By then, the company had spent $25 million and was effectively flat broke, without enough funds to pay for its weekly delivery of jet fuel. 
In desperation, it managed to acquire a bank loan for $23.7 million. This loan had to be 
backed by a guarantee from General Dynamics, which in return acquired an option to 
buy the company. (Today, General Dynamics must regret that it never exercised 
this option.)
In November of that year, the company finally achieved some financial stability 
when it raised $24.5 million from venture capitalists, investment firms that provide 
funds and advice to young companies in return for a partial ownership share. Eventually, venture capitalists invested about $90 million in Federal Express.
In 1977, private firms were allowed for the first time to compete with the Postal 
Service in package delivery. Federal Express responded by expanding its operations. 
It acquired seven Boeing 727s, each with about seven times the capacity of the Falcon 
jets. To pay for these new investments, Federal Express raised about $19 million by 
selling shares of stock to the general public in an initial public offering (IPO). The new 
stockholders became part-owners of the company in proportion to the number of 
shares they purchased.
From this point on, success followed success, and the company invested heavily to 
expand its air fleet as well as its supporting infrastructure. It introduced an automated 
shipping system and a bar-coded tracking system. In 1994, it launched its fedex.com
website for online package tracking. It opened several new hubs across the United 
States as well as in Canada, France, the Philippines, and China. In 2007, FedEx (as the 
company was now called) became the world’s largest airline measured by number of 
planes. FedEx also invested in other companies, capped by the acquisition of Kinko’s 
for $2.4 billion in 2004. By 2016, FedEx had 325,000 employees, annual revenue of 
$49 billion, and a stock market value of almost $40 billion. Its name had become a 
verb—to “FedEx a package” was to ship it overnight.
Even in retrospect, FedEx’s success was hardly a sure thing. Fred Smith’s idea was 
inspired, but its implementation was complex and difficult. FedEx had to make good 
investment decisions. In the beginning, these decisions were constrained by lack of 
financing. For example, used Falcon jets were the only option, given the young company’s precarious financial position. At first it could service only a short list of the 
major cities. As the company grew, its investment decisions became more complex. 
Which type of planes should it buy? When should it expand coverage to Europe and

 Legend has it that Smith received a grade of C on this paper. In fact, he doesn’t remember the grade.

Asia? How many operations hubs should it build? What computer and tracking systems were necessary to keep up with the increasing package volume and geographic 
coverage? Which companies should it acquire as it expanded its range of services?
FedEx also needed to make good financing decisions. For example, how should it 
raise the money it needed for investment? In the beginning, these choices were limited 
to family money and bank loans. As the company grew, its range of choices expanded. 
Eventually it was able to attract funding from venture capitalists, but this posed new 
questions. How much cash did the firm need to raise from the venture capitalists? How 
big a share in the firm would the venture capitalists demand in return? The initial public 
offering of stock prompted similar questions. How many shares should the company try 
to sell? At what price? As the company grew, it raised more funds by borrowing money 
from its banks and by selling publicly traded bonds to investors. At each point, it needed 
to decide on the proper form and terms of financing as well as the amounts to be raised.
In short, FedEx needed to be good at finance. It had a head start over potential 
competitors, but a series of bad financial decisions would have sunk the company. 
No two companies’ histories are the same, but, like FedEx, all successful comp
