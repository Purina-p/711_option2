 this 
is quite challenging. I hope eventually to move from a 
research role to become a portfolio manager.
Richard Gradley, Project Finance, Large Energy Company
After leaving college, I joined the finance department of a 
large energy company. I spent my first year helping to analyze capital investment proposals. I then moved to the project 
finance group, which is responsible for analyzing independent power projects around the world. Recently, I have been 
involved in a proposal to set up a company that would build 
and operate a large new electricity plant in southeast Asia. 
We built a spreadsheet model of the project to make sure that 
it was viable. We had to check that the contracts with the 
builders, operators, suppliers, and so on, were all in place 
before we could arrange bank financing for the project.

stocks or bonds. A financial analyst in a mutual fund analyzes the prospects for the 
securities and works with the investment manager to decide which should be bought 
and sold. Many other financial institutions also contain investment management 
departments. For example, you might work as a financial analyst in the investment 
department of an insurance company. (Insurance companies also invest in traded 
securities.) Or you could be a financial analyst in the trust department of a bank that 
manages money for retirement funds, universities, and charities.
Stockbroking firms help investment management companies and private individuals to invest in securities. They employ sales staff and dealers who make the trades. 
They also employ financial analysts to analyze the securities and help customers to 
decide which to buy or sell.
Investment banks and stockbroking firms are largely headquartered in New York, as 
are many of the large commercial banks. Insurance companies and investment management companies tend to be more scattered. For example, some of the largest insurance 
companies are headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut, and many investment management companies are located in Boston. Of course, some U.S. financial institutions have 
large businesses outside the United States. Finance is a global business. So you may 
spend some time working in a branch overseas or making the occasional trip to one of 
the other major financial centers, such as London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, or Singapore.
1.8 Preview of Coming Attractions
This book covers investment decisions, then financing decisions, and finally a variety 
of planning issues that require an understanding of both investment and financing. But 
first there are three further introductory chapters that should be helpful to readers who

Chapter 1 Goals and Governance of the Corporation 23

are making a first acquaintance with financial management. Chapter 2 is an overview 
of financial markets and institutions. Chapter 3 reviews the basic concepts of accounting, and Chapter 4 demonstrates the techniques of financial statement analysis.
We have said that the financial manager’s task is to make investment and financing 
decisions that add value for the firm’s shareholders. But that statement opens up a 
treasure chest of follow-up questions that will occupy us from Chapter 4 onward:
∙ How do I calculate the value of a stream of future cash flows? A dollar that you 
receive today is worth more than the promise of a dollar in 10 or 20 years’ time. 
So, when measuring the effect of a new project on firm value, the financial manager 
needs to recognize the timing of the cash flows. In Chapters 5 through 10, we show 
how to calculate the present value of an investment that produces a stream of future 
cash flows. We begin by calculating the present value of bonds and stocks and then 
look at how to value the cash flows resulting from capital investment projects. Present 
value is a workhorse concept of corporate finance that shows up in almost every chapter.
∙ How do I measure risk? In Chapters 5 through 10, we largely ignore the issue of 
risk. But risky cash flows are less valuable than safe ones. In Chapters 11, 12, and 
13, we look at how to measure risk and how it affects present values.
∙ Where does financing come from? Broadly speaking, it comes from borrowing or from 
cash invested or reinvested by stockholders. But financing can get complicated when 
you get down to specifics. Chapter 14 gives an overview of the sources of finance. 
Chapters 15, 16, and 17 then look at how companies sell their securities to investors, 
the choice between debt and equity, and the decision to pay out cash to stockholders.
∙ How do I ensure that the firm’s financial decisions add up to a sensible whole?
There are two parts to this question. The first is concerned with making sure that the 
firm can finance its future growth strategy. This is the role of long-term planning. 
The second is concerned with ensuring that the firm has a sensible plan for managing 
and financing its short-term assets such as cash, inventories, and money due from 
customers. We cover long- and short-term planning in Chapters 18, 19, and 20.
∙ What about some of those other responsibilities of the financial manager that you 
mentioned earlier? Not all of the financial manager’s responsibilities can be 
classified simply as an investment decision or a financing decision. In Chapters 21 
through 24, we review four such topics. First we look at mergers and acquisitions. 
Then we consider international financial management. All the financial problems 
of doing business at home are present overseas, but the international financial 
manager faces the additional complications created by multiple currencies, 
different tax systems, and special regulations imposed by foreign institutions and 
governments. Finally, we look at risk management and the specialized securities, 
including futures and options, which managers can use to hedge or lay off risks.
That’s enough material to start, but as you reflect on this chapter, you can see 
certain themes emerging that you will encounter again and again throughout this book:
1. Corporate finance is about adding value.
2. The opportunity cost of capital sets the standard for investments.
3. A safe dollar is worth more than a risky one.
4. Smart investment decisions create more value than smart financing decisions.
5. Good governance matters.
1.9 Snippets of Financial History
Now let’s lighten up a little. In this book we are going to describe how financial 
decisions are made today. But financial markets also have an interesting history. Look 
at the nearby box, which lays out bits of this history, starting in prehistoric times, when 
the growth of bacteria anticipated the mathematics of compound interest, and continuing nearly to the present. We have keyed each of these episodes to the chapter of the 
book that discusses its topic.

undertaking of great advantage but nobody to know what it 
is.” Within 5 hours he had raised £2,000; within 6 hours he 
was on his way out of the country. Readers nearly two centuries later could only wonder at the naïve or foolhardy 
investors in these ventures—that is, until they had a chance 
to participate in the follies unearthed by the financial crisis 
of 2008–2009. (Chapter 2)
1792 Formation of the New York Stock Exchange The New 
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was founded in 1792 when a 
group of brokers met under a buttonwood tree* and 
arranged to trade shares with one another at agreed rates 
of commission. Today the NYSE is the largest stock 
exchange in the world, trading on average about 1.5 billion 
shares a day. (Chapter 7)
1929 Stock Market Crashes Common stocks are risky investments. In September 1929 stock prices in the United 
States reached an all-time high, and the economist Irving 
Fisher forecast that they were at “a permanently high plateau.” Some 3 years later, stock prices were almost 90% 
lower, and it was to be a quarter of a century before the 
prices of September 1929 were seen again. Eighty years 
later, history came close to repeating itself. After stock 
prices peaked in July 2007, they slumped over the next 20 
months by 54%. (Chapter 11)
1960s Eurodollar Market In the 1950s the Soviet Union transferred its dollar holdings from the United States to a 
Russian-owned bank in Paris. This bank was best known 
by its telex address, eurobank, and consequently dollars 
held outside the United States came to be known as eurodollars. In the 1960s, U.S. taxes and regulation made it 
much cheaper to borrow and lend dollars in Europe than in 
the United States, and a huge market in eurodollars arose. 
(Chapter 14)
1971 Corporate Bankruptcies Every generation of investors 
is shocked and surprised by a major corporate bankruptcy. 
In 1971 the Penn Central Railroad, a pillar of American 
industry, suddenly collapsed. At that time, it was the largest corporate bankruptcy in history. In 2008, the investment bank Lehman Brothers smashed Penn Central’s 
record. (Chapter 16)
1972 Financial Futures Financial futures allow companies to 
protect themselves against fluctuations in interest rates, 
exchange rates, and so on. It is said that they originated 
from a remark by the economist Milton Friedman that 
he was unable to profit from his view that sterling (the U.K. 
currency) was overpriced. The Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange founded the first financial futures market. 
Today futures exchanges trade 6 billion contracts a year of 
financial futures. (Chapter 24)
1986 Capital Investment Decisions The largest investment 
project undertaken by a single private company was the 
construction of the tunnel under the English Channel. This 
started in 1986 and was completed in 1994 at a total cost 
of $15 billion. The cost of the Gorgon natural gas project in 
Australia is estimated at $54 billion. (Chapters 8, 9)
1988 Mergers The 1980s saw a wave of takeovers culminating in the $25 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco. Over a 
Date unknown Compound Growth Bacteria start to propagate by subdividing. They thereby demonstrate the power 
of compound growth. (Chapter 5)
c. 1800 b.c. Interest Rates In Babylonia, Hammurabi’s Code 
established maximum interest rates on loans. Borrowers 
often mortgaged their property and sometimes their 
spouses, but lenders were obliged to return spouses in 
good condition within 3 years. (Chapter 6)
c. 1000 b.c. Options One of the earliest recorded options is 
described by Aristotle. The philosopher Thales knew by 
the stars that there would be a great olive harvest, so, having a little money, he bought options for the use of olive 
presses. When the harvest came, Thales was able to rent 
the presses at great profit. Today financial managers need 
to be able to evaluate options to buy or sell a wide variety 
of assets. (Chapter 23)
15th century International Banking Modern international 
banking had its origins in the great Florentine banking 
houses. But the entire European network of the Medici 
empire employed only 57 people in eight offices. Today 
the London-based bank HSBC has around 260,000 
employees in 71 different countries. (Chapter 14)
1650 Futures Futures markets allow companies to protect 
themselves against fluctuations in commodity prices. 
During the Tokugawa era in Japan, feudal lords collected 
rents in the form of rice, but often they wished to trade 
their future rice deliveries. Rice futures therefore came to 
be traded on what was later known as the Dojima Rice 
Market. Rice futures are still traded, but now companies 
can also trade in futures on a range of items from pork bellies to stock market indexes. (Chapter 24)
17th century Joint Stock Corporations Although investors 
have for a long time combined together as joint owners 
of an enterprise, the modern corporation with a large number of stockholders originated with the formation in England 
of trading firms like the East India Company (est. 1599). 
(Chapter 15)
17th century Money America has been in the forefront in the 
development of new types of money. Early settlers often 
used a shell known as wampum. For example, Peter 
Stuyvesant raised a loan in wampum, and in Massachusetts it was legal tender. Unfortunately, the enterprising 
settlers found that with a little dye the relatively common 
white wampum shells could be converted profitably into 
the more valuable black ones, which confirmed Gresham’s 
law that bad money drives out good. The first issue of 
paper money in America was by the Massachusetts Bay 
Colony in 1690, and other colonies soon set their printing 
presses to producing money. In 1862 Congress agreed to 
an issue of paper money that would be legal tender. These 
notes, printed in green ink, immediately became known as 
“greenbacks.” (Chapters 19, 20)
1720 New-Issue Speculation From time to time investors 
have been tempted by speculative new issues. During 
the South Sea Bubble in England, one company was 
launched to develop perpetual motion. Another enterprising individual announced a company “for carrying on an

eight other countries. This is not the first time that different 
countries have agreed on a common currency. In 1865 
France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy came together in 
the Latin Monetary Union, and they were joined by Greece 
and Romania the following year. Members of the European 
Monetary Union (EMU) hope that the euro will be a longerlasting success than this earlier experiment. As we write 
this in early 2016, the euro appears to have weathered 
the worst of the crisis caused by the Greek government’s 
debt default. (Chapter 23)
2002 Financial Scandals A seemingly endless series of 
financial and accounting scandals climaxed in this year. 
Resulting bankruptcies included the icons Enron (and its 
accounting firm, Arthur Andersen), WorldCom, and the 
Italian food company Parmalat. Congress passed the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act to increase the accountability of corporations and executives. (Chapters 1, 14)
2007–2009 Subprime Mortgages Subprime mortgages are 
housing loans made to homeowners with shaky credit 
standing. After a decade in which housing prices had consistently gone up, lenders became complacent about the 
risks of these home loans and progressively loosened 
lending standards. When housing prices stalled and interest rates increased in 2007, many of these loans went bad. 
Some large banks such as Lehman Brothers went to the 
wall, while others such as Wachovia and Merrill Lynch 
were rescued with the aid of government money. 
(Chapters 2, 14)
2011 Defaults on Sovereign Debt By 2010 the Greek government had amassed a huge $460 billion of debt. Other 
eurozone governments and the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) rushed to Greece’s aid, but their assistance 
was insufficient, and in 2011 the Greek government 
defaulted on $100 billion of debt. It was the largest-ever 
sovereign default. Investors nervously eyed other highly 
indebted eurozone countries. (Chapter 2)

period of 6 weeks, three groups battled for control of the 
company. As one of the contestants put it, “We were 
charging through the rice paddies, not stopping for 
anything and taking no prisoners.” The takeover was the 
largest in history and generated almost $1 billion in fees 
for the banks and advisers. (Chapter 21)
1993 Inflation Financial managers need to recognize the 
effect of inflation on interest rates and on the profitability 
of the firm’s investments. In the United States inflation has 
been relatively modest, but some countries have suffered 
from hyperinflation. In Hungary after World War II, the government issued banknotes worth 1,000 trillion pengoes. In 
Yugoslavia in October 1993, prices rose by nearly 2,000% 
and a dollar bought 105 million dinars. The inflation rate in 
Venezuela in late 2015 was about 180%. (Chapter 5)
1780 and 1997 Inflation-Indexed Debt In 1780, Massachusetts paid Revolutionary War soldiers with interest-bearing 
notes rather than its rapidly eroding currency. Interest and 
principal payments on the notes were tied to the subsequent rate of inflation. After a 217-year hiatus, the U.S. 
Treasury issued inflation-indexed notes called TIPS 
(Treasury Inflation Protected Securities). Many other countries, including Britain and Israel, had done so previously. 
(Chapter 6)
1993 Controlling Risk When a company fails to keep close 
tabs on the risks being taken by its employees, it can get 
into serious trouble. This was the fate of Barings, a 
220-year-old British bank that numbered the queen among 
its clients. In 1993 it discovered that Nick Leeson, a trader 
in its Singapore office, had hidden losses of $1.3 billion 
(£869 million) from unauthorized bets on the Japanese 
equity market. The losses wiped out Barings and landed 
Leeson in jail, with a 6-year sentence. In 2008 a rogue 
trader at Morgan Stanley established a new record by losing $9 billion on unauthorized deals. (Chapter 24)
1999 The Euro Large corporations do business in many 
currencies. In 1999 a new currency came into existence 
when 11 European countries adopted the euro in place of 
their separate currencies. They have since been joined by

SUMMARY
Financial management can be broken down into (1) the investment or capital budgeting 
decision and (2) the financing decision. The firm has to decide (1) which real assets to 
invest in and (2) how to raise the funds necessary to pay for those investments.
Real assets include all assets used in the production or sale of the firms’ products or 
services. They can be tangible (plant and equipment, for example) or intangible (patents 
or trademarks, for example). In contrast, financial assets (such as stocks or bonds) are 
claims on the income generated by real assets.
Corporations are distinct, permanent legal entities. They allow for separation of ownership and control, and they can continue operating without disruption even as management 
or ownership changes. They provide limited liability to their owners. On the other hand, 
What are the two major 
decisions made by financial 
managers? (LO1-1)
What does “real asset” 
mean? (LO1-2)
What are the advantages 
and disadvantages of 
forming a corporation?
