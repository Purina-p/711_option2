 We have mentioned 5% or 20% as possible future rates of return on Virgin Atlantic’s new planes. We will see 
in Chapter 8 that future rates of return are sometimes difficult to calculate and interpret. The general 
principle always holds, however. In Chapters 8 and 9 we show you how to apply the principle by calculating 
the net present value (NPV) of investment projects.

Notice that the opportunity cost of capital depends on the risk of the proposed 
investment project. Why? It’s not just because shareholders are risk-averse. It’s also 
because shareholders have to trade off risk against return when they invest on their 
own. The safest investments, such as U.S. government debt, offer low rates of return. 
Investments with higher expected rates of return—the stock market, for example—are 
riskier and sometimes deliver painful losses. (The U.S. stock market fell 38% in 2008, 
for example.) Other investments are riskier still. For example, high-tech growth stocks 
offer the prospect of higher rates of return than typical stocks but are also more volatile 
than typical stocks.
Managers look to the financial markets to measure the opportunity cost of capital 
for the firm’s investment projects. They can observe the opportunity cost of capital for 
safe investments by looking up current interest rates on safe debt securities. For risky 
investments, the opportunity cost of capital has to be estimated. We start to tackle this 
task in Chapter 11.
1.5 Agency Problems, Executive Compensation, 
and Corporate Governance
Sole proprietors face no conflicts in financial management. They are both owners and 
managers, reaping the rewards of good decisions and hard work and suffering when 
they make bad decisions or slack off. Their personal wealth is tied to the value of their 
businesses.
In most large corporations, the owners are mostly outside investors, and so the 
managers may be tempted to act in their own interests rather than maximize shareholder value. For example, they may shy away from valuable but risky investment 
projects because they worry more about job security than maximizing value. They 
may build empires by overaggressive investment or overconfident acquisitions of 
other companies.
The temptation for such value-destroying actions arises because the managers are 
not the shareholders, but agents of the shareholders. Therefore, the actions are called 
agency problems. Losses in value from agency problems—or from costs incurred to 
mitigate the problems—are called agency costs.
Agency problems sometimes lead to outrageous behavior. When Dennis 
Kozlowski, the former CEO of Tyco, threw a $2 million birthday bash for his wife, 
he charged half the cost to the company. Conrad Black, the former boss of Hollinger 
International, used the company jet for a trip with his wife to Bora Bora. These, of 
course, are extreme examples. The agency problems encountered in the ordinary 
course of business are often subtle and mundane. But agency problems do arise 
whenever managers think just a little less hard about spending money that is not 
their own.

Investing $100,000 in additional raw materials, mostly palladium, should allow 
Cryogenic Concepts to increase production and earn an additional $112,000 
next year. This payoff could cover the investment, plus a 12% return. Palladium is 
traded in commodity markets. The CFO has studied the history of returns from 
investments in palladium and believes that investors in the precious metal 
can reasonably expect a 15% return. What is the opportunity cost of capital? 
Is Cryogenic’s proposed investment in palladium a good idea? Why or why not?

Think of the corporation’s value as a pie that is divided among several classes of 
claimants. These include managers and workers as well as shareholders and lenders. 
The government is a claimant, too, because it taxes sales and profits. The claimants are 
called stakeholders because each has a stake in the firm. Agency problems arise 
whenever the stakeholders’ interests do not coincide.

interest in the corporation.

 Most restricted stock does not “vest” immediately. Suppose the vesting period is 3 years. If the manager quits 
or is fired in year 2, the restricted stock stays behind. Vesting gives the managers an incentive to stay at the 
corporation, in this example, for at least 3 years.
Agency problems are controlled in practice in three ways. First, corporations set up 
internal controls and decision-making procedures to prevent wasteful spending and 
discourage careless investment. We discuss the controls and procedures in several later 
chapters. For example, Chapters 8, 9, and 10 cover procedures for disciplined, valuemaximizing capital investment decisions. Second, corporations try to design compensation schemes that align managers’ and shareholders’ interests. Third, the corporations 
are constrained by corporate governance. We comment on compensation and governance here.
Executive Compensation
The compensation packages of top executives are almost always tied to the financial 
performance of their companies. The package typically includes a fixed base salary 
plus an annual award tied to earnings or other measures of financial performance. 
The more senior the manager, the smaller the base salary as a fraction of total compensation. Also, compensation is not all in cash, but partly in shares. The shares are 
usually restricted stock, which the manager is required to hold onto while employed 
by the corporation.8
 Many corporations also include stock options in compensation 
packages. Stock options, which we cover in Chapter 23, give especially powerful 
incentives to maximize stock price per share.
The upside compensation potential for a few top managers is enormous. For example, Larry Ellison, CEO of the business software giant Oracle, received total compensation of $64 million for 2015. Only $1 of that amount was base salary. The rest came 
from grants of stock and options. The options will be worthless if Oracle’s stock price 
falls from its 2015 level but will pay off handsomely if the price rises. In addition, as a 
founder of Oracle, Ellison owns shares worth $49 billion. No one can say for certain 
how hard Ellison would have worked with a different compensation package, but one 
thing is clear: He has a huge personal stake in Oracle’s market value.
Well-designed compensation schemes alleviate agency problems by encouraging 
managers to maximize shareholder wealth. But some schemes are not well designed; 
they reward managers even when value is destroyed. For example, during Robert 
Nardelli’s 6-year tenure as CEO, Home Depot’s stock price fell by 20% while shares of 
its rival Lowe’s nearly doubled. When Nardelli was ousted in January 2007, he received 
a farewell package worth $210 million. Needless to say, many shareholders were livid.
In 2010, the Dodd-Frank financial reform law gave U.S. shareholders the right to 
express their opinion on executive compensation through nonbinding “say on pay” 
votes at 1- or 3-year intervals. (Shareholders of U.K. companies have a similar right.) 
What are agency problems and agency costs? Give two or three examples of 
decisions by managers that can lead to agency costs.

 A large block of shares may give effective control even when there is no majority owner. For example, Larry 
Ellison’s billion-plus shares give him a 25% stake in Oracle. Barring some extreme catastrophe, this holding 
means that he can run the company as long as he wants to.
Most votes have endorsed compensation policy, but occasionally shareholders refuse. 
For example, in 2011 Hewlett-Packard’s shareholders voted against a $40 million compensation package for its new CEO. When there is a “no” vote, the company generally 
changes the pay package to make it less generous; other companies look anxiously over 
their shoulders to check that their compensation package is not next in the spotlight.
Corporate Governance
Financial markets and institutions are supposed to direct financing to firms that can 
invest to add value. But financing moves from investors to firms only if investors are 
protected and if agency problems within firms are absent or at least tolerable. Thus 
there is a need for a system of corporate governance so that money can flow to the 
right firms at the right times. “Corporate governance” refers to the laws, regulations, 
institutions, and corporate practices that protect shareholders and other investors. 
When scandals happen, we say that corporate governance has broken down. When 
corporations compete to deliver value to shareholders, we are comforted that corporate 
governance is working properly.
Good corporate governance relies in part on well-designed management compensation packages. Other elements of good corporate governance include the following.
Legal Requirements Good governance requires laws and regulations that protect 
investors from self-dealing by insiders. CEOs and financial managers have a fiduciary 
duty to stockholders. That is, they are required to act fairly and responsibly in the 
stockholders’ interests. If they don’t, they may end up in jail like Tyco’s Dennis 
Kozlowski and Hollinger’s Conrad Black.
Boards of Directors The board of directors appoints top managers, including the 
CEO and CFO, and must approve important financial decisions. For example, only 
the board has legal authority to approve a dividend or a public issue of securities. The 
board approves compensation schemes and awards to top management. Boards usually 
delegate decision making for small and medium-size investments, but the authority to 
approve large investments is almost never delegated.
The board of directors is elected by shareholders and is supposed to represent their 
interests. Boards have been portrayed as passive supporters of top management, but 
the balance has tipped toward independence. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) 
requires that more directors be independent—that is, not affiliated with management. 
The majority of directors are now independent. Boards must also meet in executive 
sessions with the CEO not present. SOX also requires CEOs and CFOs to sign off 
personally on the corporation’s accounting procedures and results.
Activist Shareholders Institutional shareholders, including pension funds, have 
become more active in monitoring management and pushing for changes. CEOs have 
been forced out as a result, including the CEOs of JCPenney, Procter & Gamble, Barnes 
& Noble, Citigroup, Yahoo!, and Carnival. Boards outside the United States, which 
have traditionally been more management-friendly, have also become more willing to 
replace underperformers. The list of foreign companies with CEO departures includes 
Barclays, Carrefour, Siemens, Barrick, and Rio Tinto.
Although U.S. corporations typically have thousands of individual shareholders, 
they often also have blockholders, that is, investors who own 5%, 10%, or more of 
outstanding shares. The blockholders may include wealthy individuals or families—
for example, descendants of a founder. They may also include other corporations, 
pension funds, or foundations.9
 When a 5% blockholder calls, the CFO answers.

The laws, regulations, 
institutions, and corporate 
practices that protect 
shareholders and other 
investors.

10 Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (New York: Random House, 
1937; first published 1776), p. 14.
11 Shareholders value integrity. Firms that are regarded as trustworthy by their employees and that are voted as 
good places to work tend to be more highly valued by investors and to perform better. See A. Edmans, “Does 
the Stock Market Fully Value Intangibles? Employee Satisfaction and Equity Prices,” Journal of Financial 
Economics 101, no. 3 (September 2011), pp. 621–640; and L. Guiso, P. Sapienza, and L. Zingales, “The Value 
of Corporate Culture,” Journal of Financial Economics 117, no. 1 (July 2015), pp. 60–76.
Disgruntled shareholders can also take the “Wall Street Walk” by selling out and 
moving on to other investments. The Wall Street Walk can send a powerful message. 
If enough shareholders bail out, the stock price tumbles, which damages top managers’ compensation and reputation.
Takeovers The Wall Street Walk also opens the door for takeovers. The further the 
stock price falls, the easier it is for another company to buy up the majority of shares 
and take over. The old management team is then likely to find itself out on the street. 
We discuss takeovers in Chapter 21.
Information for Investors Corporate governance can’t work unless outside investors 
get detailed, up-to-date information. If a firm is transparent—if investors can see its true 
profitability and prospects—then problems will show up right away in a falling stock 
price. That in turn generates extra scrutiny from security analysts, bond rating agencies, 
and banks and other lenders, who keep an eagle eye on the progress of their borrowers.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sets accounting and reporting standards for public companies. We cover accounting and finance in Chapter 3.
Chapter 1 is not the right place for a worldwide tour of corporate governance. But be 
aware that governance laws, regulations, and practice vary. The differences are more 
dramatic in continental Europe and Japan than in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other English-speaking countries. In Germany, for example, banks often control 
large blocks of stock and can push hard for changes in the management or strategy of 
poorly performing companies. (Banks in the United States are prohibited from large or 
permanent holdings of the stock of nonfinancial corporations.) Large German firms also 
have two boards of directors: the supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) and the management 
board (Vorstand). Half of the supervisory board’s members are elected by employees. 
Some French firms also have two boards, one including employee representatives.
1.6 The Ethics of Maximizing Value
Shareholders want managers to maximize the market value of their shares. But perhaps this begs the question: Is it desirable for managers to act in the narrow, selfish 
interest of their shareholders? Does a focus on shareholder value mean that the managers must act as greedy mercenaries riding roughshod over widows and orphans?
Most of this book is devoted to financial policies that increase value. None of these 
policies requires galloping over widows and orphans. In most instances, there is little 
conflict between doing well (maximizing value) and doing good. The first step in doing 
well is doing good by your customers. Here is how Adam Smith put the case in 1776:
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our 
dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity 
but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.10
Profitable firms are those with satisfied customers and loyal employees; firms with 
dissatisfied customers and a disgruntled workforce will probably end up with declining profits and a low stock price.11
Of course, ethical issues do arise in business as in other walks of life. When the 
stakes are high, it is often tempting for managers to cut corners. Laws and regulations 
seek to prevent managers from undertaking dishonest actions. But written rules and 
laws can help only so much. In business, as in other day-to-day affairs, there are also

unwritten rules of behavior. They are reinforced because good managers know that 
their firm’s reputation is one of its most important assets, and therefore playing fair 
and keeping one’s word are simply good business practices. Thus financial deals are 
regularly sealed by a handshake, and each side knows that the other will not renege 
later if things turn sour.
Reputation is particularly important in finance. If you buy a well-known brand in a 
supermarket, you can be fairly sure of what you are getting. But in financial transactions, the other party often has more information than you, and it is less easy to be sure 
of the quality of what you are buying. Therefore, honest financial firms seek to build 
long-term relationships with their customers and to establish a name for fair dealing 
and financial integrity. Major banks and securities firms protect their reputations.
When something happens to undermine reputations, the costs can be enormous. 
Volkswagen (VW) is a recent case in point. VW had installed secret software that cut 
back pollution from its diesel cars, but only when the cars were tested. Actual pollution in regular driving was much higher—and far in excess of legal maximums. 
Discovery of the software scandal in 2015 caused a tidal wave of opprobrium. VW’s 
stock price dropped by 35%. Its CEO was fired. VW diesel vehicles piled up unsold on 
car dealers’ lots. Potential fines imposed by the U.S. and European governments could 
be enormous. VW set aside $7.3 billion to cover costs and losses, but some analysts 
viewed this amount as much too low.
Charlatans and swindlers sometimes prey on individual investors, especially in 
booming markets. (It’s only “when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been 
swimming naked.”12) The tide went out in 2008 and a number of frauds were exposed. 
One notorious example was the Ponzi scheme run by the disgraced financier Bernard 
Madoff (pronounced “Made-off ”).13 Individuals and institutions invested around 
$20 billion with Madoff and were told that their investments had grown to $65 billion. 
That figure turned out to be completely fictitious. (It’s not clear what Madoff did with 
all this money, but much of it was apparently paid out to early investors in the scheme to 
create an impression of superior investment performance.) With hindsight, the investors 
should not have trusted Madoff or the financial advisers who steered money to him.
Madoff’s Ponzi scheme was (we hope) a once-in-a-lifetime event. (Ponzi schemes 
pop up frequently, but few have approached the scope and duration of Madoff’s.) 
It was astonishingly unethical and illegal and was bound to end in tears. Needless to 
say, it was not designed to add value for investors.

Ponzi Scheme
12 The quotation is from Warren Buffett’s annual letter to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, March 2008.
13 Ponzi schemes are named after Charles Ponzi, who founded an investment company in 1920 that promised 
investors unbelievably high returns. He was soon deluged with funds from investors in New England, taking in 
$1 million during one 3-hour period. Ponzi invested only about $30 of the money that he raised. But he used part of 
the cash provided by later investors to pay generous dividends to the original investors, thus promoting the illusion 
of high profits and quick payoffs. Within months the scheme collapsed and Ponzi started a 5-year prison sentence.
Without knowing anything about the personal ethics of the owners, which 
company would you trust more to keep its word in a business deal?
a. Harry’s Hardware has been in business for 50 years. Harry’s grandchildren, 
now almost adults, plan to take over and operate the business. Successful 
hardware stores depend on long-term loyal customers.
b. Victor’s Videos just opened for business. It rents a storefront in a strip mall 
and has financed its inventory with a bank loan. Victor has little of his own 
money invested in the business. Video shops usually command little 
customer loyalty.

But sometimes raids can enhance shareholder value. For 
example, in 2012 and 2013, Relational Investors teamed up 
with the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CSTRS, 
a pension fund) to try to force Timken Co. to split into two 
separate companies, one for its steel business and one for its 
industrial bearings business. Relational and CSTRS believed 
that Timken’s combination of unrelated businesses was unfocused and inefficient. Timken management responded that 
breakup would “deprive our shareholders of long-run value—
all in an attempt to create illusory short-term gains through 
financial engineering.” But Timken’s stock price rose at the 
prospect of a breakup, and a nonbinding shareholder vote on 
Relational’s proposal attracted a 53% majority. Finally in 2014 
Timken spun off its steel business in a new corporation, 
Timken Steel.
How do you draw the ethical line in such examples? Was 
Relational Investors a “raider” (sounds bad) or an “activist 
investor” (sounds good)? Breaking up a portfolio of businesses can create difficult
