anies 
must make good investment and financing decisions. And, as with FedEx, those 
decisions range from prosaic and obvious to difficult and strategically crucial.
Let’s widen our discussion. Table 1.1 gives an example of a recent investment and 
financing decision for 11 corporations. Seven are U.S. corporations. Four are foreign: 
Virgin Atlantic’s headquarters are in London, TransCanada’s in Calgary, LVMH’s in 
Paris,2
 and Vale’s in Rio de Janeiro. We have chosen very large public corporations 
that you are likely to be familiar with. You may have flown with Virgin Atlantic, 
shopped at Walmart, or posted a picture on Facebook.

Take a look at the decisions now. We think you will agree that they appear 
sensible—at least there is nothing obviously wrong with them. But if you are new to 
finance, it may be difficult to think about why these companies made these decisions 
and not others.
The Investment (Capital Budgeting) Decision
Investment decisions, such as those shown in Table 1.1, are also called capital 
budgeting or capital expenditure (CAPEX) decisions. Some of the investments in 
the table, such as Walmart’s new stores or Virgin Atlantic’s new planes, involve 
tangible assets—assets that you can touch and kick. Others involve intangible assets, 
such as research and development (R&D), advertising, and the design of computer 
software. For example, major pharmaceutical manufacturers invest billions every year 
on R&D for new drugs.
Most of the investments in Table 1.1 have long-term consequences. For example, 
the planes acquired by Virgin Atlantic may still be flying 20 or 30 years from now. 
Other investments may pay off in only a few months. For example, with the approach 
of the Christmas holidays, Walmart spends nearly $50 billion to stock up its warehouses and retail stores. As the goods are sold over the following months, the company 
recovers its investment in these inventories.
The world of business can be intensely competitive, and corporations prosper only 
if they can keep launching new products or services. In some cases, the costs and risks 
of doing so are amazingly large. For example, the cost of developing the Gorgon 
natural gas field in Australia has been estimated at $54 billion. It’s not surprising that 
this cost is being shared among several major energy companies. But do not think of 
companies as making billion-dollar investments on a daily basis. Most investment 
decisions are smaller, such as the purchase of a truck, machine tool, or computer 
system. Corporations make thousands of such investments each year. The cumulative 
amount of these small expenditures can be just as large as the occasional jumbo investments, such as those shown in Table 1.1.
Not all investments succeed. In October 2011 Hewlett-Packard (HP) paid $11.1 
billion to acquire the British software company Autonomy. Just 13 months later, 
HP wrote down the value of this investment by $8.8 billion. HP claimed that it was 
misled by improper accounting at Autonomy. Nevertheless, the Autonomy acquisition 
was a disastrous investment for HP. HP’s CEO was fired in short order.
There are no free guarantees in finance. But you can tilt the odds in your favor if 
you learn the tools of investment analysis and apply them intelligently. We cover these 
tools in detail later in this book.
The Financing Decision
The financial manager’s second main responsibility is to raise the money that the firm 
requires for its investments and operations. This is the financing decision. When a 
company needs to raise money, it can invite investors to put up cash in exchange for a 
share of future profits, or it can promise to pay back the investors’ cash plus a fixed 
rate of interest. In the first case, the investors receive shares of stock and become 
shareholders, part-owners of the corporation. The investors in this case are referred to 
as equity investors, who contribute equity financing. In the second case, the investors 
are lenders, that is, debt investors, who one day must be repaid. The choice between 
debt and equity financing is often called the capital structure decision. Here “capital” 
refers to the firm’s sources of long-term financing. A firm that is seeking to raise longterm financing is said to be “raising capital.”
Notice the essential difference between the investment and financing decisions. 
When the firm invests, it acquires real assets, which are then used to produce the 
firm’s goods and services. The firm finances its investment in real assets by issuing 
financial assets to investors. A share of stock is a financial asset, which has value as a 
capital budgeting or capital 
expenditure (CAPEX) decision
Decision to invest in 
tangible or intangible 
assets.
financing decision
Decision on the sources 
and amounts of financing.
real assets
Assets used to produce 
goods and services.
financial assets
Financial claims to the 
income generated by the 
firm’s real assets.

claim on the firm’s real assets and on the income that those assets will produce. 
A bank loan is a financial asset also. It gives the bank the right to get its money back plus 
interest. If the firm’s operations can’t generate enough income to repay the bank, the 
bank can force the firm into bankruptcy and stake a claim on its real assets. Financial 
assets that can be purchased and traded by investors in public markets are called securities. The shares of stock issued by the public corporations in Table 1.1 are all securities. 
Entergy’s 10-year bond in Table 1.1 is a security. But a bank loan from JPMorgan to 
Entergy is not called a security unless the bank resells the loan to public investors.
The firm can issue an almost endless variety of financial assets. Suppose it decides 
to borrow. It can issue debt to investors, or it can borrow from a bank. It can borrow for 
1 year or 20 years. If it borrows for 20 years, it can reserve the right to pay off the debt 
early if interest rates fall. It can borrow in Paris, receiving and promising to repay 
euros, or it can borrow dollars in New York. (As Table 1.1 shows, Ford chose to borrow U.S. dollars, but it could have borrowed euros or Japanese yen instead.)
In some ways, financing decisions are less important than investment decisions. 
Financial managers say that “value comes mainly from the investment side of the balance sheet.” Also, the most successful corporations sometimes have the simplest 
financing strategies. Take Microsoft as an example. It is one of the world’s most valuable corporations. In early 2016, Microsoft shares traded for $53 each. There were 7.91 
billion shares outstanding. Therefore Microsoft’s market value—its market capitalization or market cap—was 53 × 7.91 = $419 billion. Where did this market value come 
from? It came from Microsoft’s products, from its brand name and worldwide customer base, from its R&D, and from its ability to make profitable future investments. 
It did not come from sophisticated financing. Microsoft’s financing strategy is very 
simple: It finances almost all investment by retaining and reinvesting operating cash flow.
Financing decisions may not add much value compared to good investment decisions, but they can destroy value if they are stupid or ambushed by bad news. For 
example, when a consortium of investment companies bought the energy giant TXU in 
2007, the company took on an additional $40 billion in debt. This may not have been a 
stupid decision, but it did prove fatal. The consortium did not foresee the expansion of 
shale gas production and the resulting sharp fall in natural gas and electricity prices, 
and in April 2014 the company (renamed Energy Future Holdings) was bankrupt.
We have emphasized the financial manager’s responsibility for two decisions:
The investment decision = purchase of real assets
The financing decision = sale of financial assets
But this is an oversimplification because the financial manager is also involved in many 
other day-to-day activities that are essential to the smooth operation of a business. 
Are the following capital budgeting or financing decisions? (Hint: In one case the 
answer is “both.”)
a. Intel decides to spend $7 billion to develop a new microprocessor factory.
b. BMW borrows 350 million euros (€350 million) from Deutsche Bank.
c. Royal Dutch Shell constructs a pipeline to bring natural gas onshore from a 
production platform in Australia.
d. Avon spends €200 million to launch a new range of cosmetics in European 
markets.
e. Pfizer issues new shares to buy a small biotech company.

For example, if the firm sells goods or services on credit, it needs to make sure that its 
customers pay on time. Corporations that operate internationally must constantly transfer cash from one currency to another. And the manager must keep an eye on the risks 
that the firm runs and ensure that they don’t land the firm in a pickle.

 In the United States, corporations are identified by the label “Corporation,” “Incorporated,” or “Inc.,” as in 
Caterpillar Inc. The United Kingdom identifies public corporations by “plc” (short for “Public Limited 
Corporation”). French corporations have the suffix “SA” (“Société Anonyme”). The corresponding labels in 
Germany are “GmbH” (“Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung”) and “AG” (“Aktiengesellschaft”).
4
 “Shareholder” and “stockholder” mean exactly the same thing and are used interchangeably.
1.2 What Is a Corporation?
We have been referring to “corporations.” But before going too far or too fast, we need 
to offer some basic definitions.
A corporation is a distinct, permanent legal entity. Suppose you decide to create a 
new corporation.3
 You would work with a lawyer to prepare articles of incorporation,
which set out the purpose of the business and how it is to be financed, managed, and 
governed. These articles must conform to the laws of the state in which the business is 
incorporated. For many purposes, the corporation is considered a resident of its state. 
For example, it can enter into contracts, borrow or lend money, and sue or be sued. 
It pays its own taxes (but it cannot vote!).
A corporation’s owners are called shareholders or stockholders.4
 The shareholders 
do not directly own the business’s real assets (factories, oil wells, stores, etc.). Instead 
they have indirect ownership via financial assets (the shares of the corporation).
A corporation is legally distinct from the shareholders. Therefore, the shareholders 
have limited liability and cannot be held personally responsible for the corporation’s 
debts. When the U.S. financial corporation Lehman Brothers failed in 2008, no one 
demanded that its stockholders put up more money to cover Lehman’s massive debts. 
Shareholders can lose their entire investment in a corporation, but no more.
corporation
A business organized as a 
separate legal entity 
owned by stockholders.
limited liability
The owners of a 
corporation are not 
personally liable for its 
obligations.
Business Organization
Suppose you buy a building and open a restaurant. You have invested in the building itself, 
kitchen equipment, dining-room furnishings, plus various other assets. If you do not incorporate, you own these assets personally, as the sole proprietor of the business. If you have 
borrowed money from a bank to start the business, then you are personally responsible for 
this debt. If the business loses money and cannot pay the bank, then the bank can demand 
Example 1.1 ⊲
Which of the following are financial assets, and which are real assets?
a. A patent.
b. A share of stock issued by Wells Fargo Bank.
c. A blast furnace in a steelmaking factory.
d. A mortgage loan taken out to help pay for a new home.
e. After a successful advertising campaign, potential customers trust FedEx to 
deliver packages promptly and reliably.
f. An IOU (“I owe you”) from your brother-in-law.

Chapter 1 Goals and Governance of the Corporation 9
bre22619_ch01_002-031.indd 9 10/06/16 03:32 PM
When a corporation is first established, its shares may be privately owned by a 
small group of investors, perhaps the company’s managers and a few backers. In this 
case, the shares are not publicly traded and the company is closely held. Eventually, 
when the firm grows and new shares are issued to raise additional capital, its shares 
are traded in public markets such as the New York Stock Exchange. Such corporations 
are known as public companies. Most well-known corporations in the United States 
are public companies with widely dispersed shareholdings. In other countries, it is 
more common for large corporations to remain in private hands, and many public 
companies may be controlled by just a handful of investors.
A large public corporation may have hundreds of thousands of shareholders, who 
together own the business. An individual may have 100 shares, receive 100 votes, and 
be entitled to a tiny fraction of the firm’s income and value. On the other hand, a 
pension fund or insurance company may own millions of shares, receive millions of 
votes, and have a correspondingly large stake in the firm’s performance.
Public shareholders cannot possibly manage or control the corporation directly. 
Instead, they elect a board of directors, who in turn appoint the top managers and 
monitor their performance. This separation of ownership and control gives corporations 
permanence. Even if managers quit or are dismissed, the corporation survives. Today’s 
stockholders can sell all their shares to new investors without disrupting the operations 
of the business. Corporations can, in principle, live forever, and in practice they may 
survive many human lifetimes. One of the oldest corporations is the Hudson’s Bay 
Company, which was formed in 1670 to profit from the fur trade between northern 
Canada and England. The company still operates as one of Canada’s leading retail chains.
The separation of corporate ownership and control can also have a downside, for it 
can open the door for managers and directors to act in their own interests rather than in 
the stockholders’ interest. We return to this problem later in the chapter.
There are other disadvantages to being a corporation. One is the cost, in both time 
and money, of managing the corporation’s legal machinery. These costs are particularly burdensome for small businesses.
There is also an important tax drawback to corporations in the United States. 
Because the corporation is a separate legal entity, it is taxed separately. So corporations pay tax on their profits, and shareholders are taxed again when they receive 
dividends from the company or sell their shares at a profit. By contrast, income generated by businesses that are not incorporated is taxed just once as personal income.6
Other Forms of Business Organization
Corporations do not have to be prominent, multinational businesses such as those 
listed in Table 1.1. You can organize a local plumbing contractor or barber shop as a 
corporation if you want to take the trouble. But most corporations are larger

that you raise cash by selling other assets—your car or house, for example—in order to repay 
the loan. But if you incorporate the restaurant business, and then the corporation borrows 
from the bank, your other assets are shielded from the restaurant’s debts. Of course, 
incorporation also means that the bank will be more cautious in lending, because the bank 
will have no recourse to your other assets.5
Notice that if you incorporate your business, you exchange direct ownership of its real 
assets (the building, kitchen equipment, etc.) for indirect ownership via financial assets 
(the shares of the new corporation). ■
5
 The bank may ask you to put up personal assets as collateral for the loan to your restaurant corporation. But it 
has to ask and get your agreement. It doesn’t have to ask if your business is a sole proprietorship.
6
 The U.S. tax system is somewhat unusual in this respect. To avoid taxing the same income twice, many other 
countries give shareholders at least some credit for the taxes that the corporation has already paid.

businesses or businesses that aspire to grow. Small “mom-and-pop” businesses are 
usually organized as sole proprietorships.
What about the middle ground? What about businesses that grow too large for sole 
proprietorships but don’t want to reorganize as corporations? For example, suppose 
you wish to pool money and expertise with some friends or business associates.
