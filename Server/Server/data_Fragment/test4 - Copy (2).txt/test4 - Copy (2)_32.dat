quired outside 
capital beyond personal loans to the proprietor. There 
was little need, therefore, for firms to produce comprehensive accounting information. But with the industrial 
revolution and the creation of large railroad and canal 
companies, the shareholders and bankers demanded 
information that would help them gauge a firm’s financial strength. That was when the accounting profession 
began to come of age.
We don’t want to get lost in the details of accounting 
practice. But because we will refer to financial statements throughout this book, it may be useful to review 
briefly their main features. In this chapter, we introduce 
the major financial statements: the balance sheet, the 
income statement, and the statement of cash flows. We 
discuss the important differences between income and 
cash flow and between book values and market values. 
We also discuss the federal tax system.
This chapter is our first look at financial statements 
and is meant primarily to serve as a brief review of your 
accounting class. It will be far from our last look. For 
example, we will see in the next chapter how managers 
use financial statements to analyze a firm’s performance 
and assess its financial strength.
Accounting is not the same as finance, but the two are related.

The Balance Sheet
Public companies are obliged to file their financial statements with the SEC each quarter. These quarterly reports (or 10Qs) provide the investor with information about the 
company’s earnings during the quarter and its assets and liabilities at the end of 
the quarter. In addition, companies need to file annual financial statements (or 10Ks) 
that provide rather more detailed information about the outcome for the entire year.
The financial statements show the firm’s balance sheet, the income statement, and 
a statement of cash flows. We will review each in turn.1
Firms need to raise cash to pay for the many assets used in their businesses. In the 
process of raising that cash, they also acquire obligations or “liabilities” to those who 
provide the funding. The balance sheet presents a snapshot of the firm’s assets and 
liabilities at one particular moment. The assets—representing the uses of the funds 
raised—are listed on the left-hand side of the balance sheet. The liabilities—
representing the sources of that funding—are listed on the right.
Some assets can be turned more easily into cash than others; these are known as 
liquid assets. The accountant puts the most liquid assets at the top of the list and works 
down to the least liquid. Look, for example, at Table 3.1, which shows the consolidated balance sheet for Home Depot (HD), at the end of its 2014 fiscal year.2
 (“Consolidated” simply means that the balance sheet shows the position of Home Depot and 
any companies it owns.) You can see that Home Depot had $1,723 million of cash and 
marketable securities. In addition, it had sold goods worth $1,484 million but had not 
yet received payment. These payments are due soon, and therefore the balance sheet 
shows the unpaid bills or accounts receivable (or simply receivables) as a current 
asset. The next asset consists of inventories. These may be (1) raw materials and ingredients that the firm bought from suppliers, (2) work in progress, and (3) finished products waiting to be shipped from the warehouse. For Home Depot, inventories consist 
largely of goods in the warehouse or on the store shelves; for manufacturing companies, inventories would be more skewed toward raw materials and work in progress. 
Of course, there are always some items that don’t fit into neat categories. So there is a 
fourth entry, other current assets.
Up to this point, all the assets in Home Depot’s balance sheet are likely to be used 
or turned into cash in the near future. They are therefore described as current assets.
The next assets listed in the balance sheet are longer-lived or fixed assets and include 
items such as buildings, equipment, and vehicles.
The balance sheet shows that the gross value of Home Depot’s property, plant, and 
equipment is $40,353 million. This is what the assets originally cost. But they are 
unlikely to be worth that now. For example, suppose the company bought a delivery 
van 2 years ago; that van may be worth far less now than Home Depot paid for it. 
It might, in principle, be possible for the accountant to estimate separately the value 
today of the van, but this would be costly and somewhat subjective. Accountants rely 
instead on rules of thumb to estimate the depreciation in the value of ass
