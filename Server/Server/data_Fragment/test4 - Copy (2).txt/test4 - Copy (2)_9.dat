r later cannot pay existing debts. Nor can it raise new equity financing if shareholders see that new equity investment will follow previous investments down the drain.
This firm’s managers would probably pay the price for this business malpractice. 
For example, outside investors would see an opportunity for easy money. They could 
buy the firm from its current shareholders, toss out the managers, and reemphasize 
value rather than market share. The investors would profit from the increase in value 
under new management.
Managers who pursue goals that destroy value often end in early retirement—
another reason that the natural financial goal of the corporation is to maximize 
market value.
The Investment Trade-Off Okay, let’s take the objective as maximizing market 
value, or at least adding market value. But why do some investments increase market 
value, while others reduce it? The answer is given by Figure 1.3, which sets out the 
fundamental trade-off for corporate investment decisions. The corporation has a 
proposed investment project (the purchase of a real asset). Suppose it has sufficient 
cash on hand to finance the project. The financial manager is trying to decide whether 
to go ahead. If he or she decides not to invest, the corporation can pay out the cash 
to shareholders, say as an extra dividend. (The investment and dividend arrows in 
Figure 1.3 are arrows 2 and 4b in Figure 1.2.)
Assume that the financial manager is acting in the interests of the corporation’s 
owners, its stockholders. What do these stockholders want the financial manager to do?

Rhonda and Reggie Hotspur are working hard to save for their children’s college 
education. They don’t need more cash for current consumption but will face big 
tuition bills in 2025. Should they therefore avoid investing in stocks that pay 
generous current cash dividends? (Hint: Are they required to spend the 
dividends on current consumption?) Explain briefly.

The answer depends on the rate of return on the investment project and on the rate of 
return that stockholders can earn by investing in financial markets. If the return offered 
by the investment project is higher than the rate of return that shareholders can get by 
investing on their own, then the shareholders would vote for the investment project. 
If the investment project offers a lower return than shareholders can achieve on their 
own, the shareholders would vote to cancel the project and take the cash instead.
Figure 1.3 could apply to Virgin Atlantic’s decisions to invest in new aircraft. 
Suppose the company has cash set aside to buy five more Airbus A350-1000s. It could 
go ahead with the purchase, or it could choose to cancel the investment and instead pay 
out the cash to its stockholders. If it pays out the cash, the stockholders could then 
invest for themselves.
Suppose that Virgin’s investment in new planes is just about as risky as the stock 
market and that investment in the stock market offers a 10% expected rate of return. 
If the new planes offer a superior rate of return, say 20%, then Virgin’s stockholders 
would be happy to let the company keep the cash and invest it in the new planes. 
If the planes offer only a 5% return, then the stockholders are better off with the cash 
and without the new project; in that case, the financial manager should turn down 
the project.
As long as a corporation’s proposed investments offer higher rates of return than its 
shareholders can earn for themselves in the stock market (or in other financial 
markets), its shareholders will applaud the investments and the market value of the 
firm will increase. But if the company earns an inferior return, shareholders boo, 
market value falls, and stockholders clamor to get their money back so that they can 
invest on their own.
In our example, the minimum acceptable rate of return on Virgin’s new aircraft 
is 10%. This minimum rate of return is called the hurdle rate or opportunity cost of 
capital. It is called an opportunity cost of capital because it depends on the alternative 
investment opportunities available to shareholders in financial markets. Whenever a 
corporation invests cash in a new project, its shareholders lose the opportunity to 
invest the cash on their own. Corporations increase value by accepting investment 
projects that earn more than the opportunity cost of capital.
Figure 1.3, which compares rates of return on investment projects with the opportunity cost of capital, illustrates a general principle: A corporation should direct cash to 
investments that add market value, compared with the investments that shareholders 
could make on their own.7
