s provide financing for business. They channel 
savings to real investment. That much should be loud and clear from Sections 2.1 and 
2.2 of this chapter. But there are other functions that may not be quite so obvious.

Transporting Cash across Time
Individuals need to transport expenditures in time. If you have money now that you 
wish to save for a rainy day, you can (for example) put the money in a savings account 
at a bank and withdraw it with interest later. If you don’t have money today, say to buy 
a car, you can borrow money from the bank and pay off the loan later. Modern finance 
provides a kind of time machine. Lenders transport money forward in time; borrowers 
transport it back. Both are happier than if they were forced to spend income as it 
arrives. Of course, individuals are not alone in needing to raise cash from time to time. 
Firms with good investment opportunities, but a shortage of internally generated cash, 
raise cash by borrowing or selling new shares. Many governments run deficits and 
finance current outlays by issuing debt.
Young people saving for retirement may transport their current earnings 30 or 40 
years into the future by means of a pension fund. They can even transport income to 
their heirs by purchase of a life insurance policy
