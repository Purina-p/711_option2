useful context for the work ahead. For example, it will 
help you to understand why you are calculating the 
yield to maturity of a bond in Chapter 6, the net present 
value of a capital investment in Chapter 9, or the 
weighted-average cost of capital for a company in 
Chapter 13.
This chapter does three things. First, it surveys financial markets and institutions. We will cover the stock and 
bond markets, banks and insurance companies, and 
mutual and pension funds. Second, we will set out the 
functions of financial markets and institutions and look 
at how they help corporations and the economy. Third, 
we will discuss the financial crisis of 2007–2009 and 
the eurozone crisis that followed. An understanding of 
what happens when financial markets do not function 
well is important for understanding why and how financial markets and institutions matter.

The Importance of Financial Markets 
and Institutions
In the previous chapter, we explained why corporations need to be good at finance in 
order to survive and prosper. All corporations face important investment and financing 
decisions. But, of course, those decisions are not made in a vacuum. They are made in 
a financial environment. That environment has two main segments: financial markets 
and financial institutions.
Businesses have to go to financial markets and institutions for the financing they 
need to grow. When they have a surplus of cash, and no need for immediate financing, 
they have to invest the cash, for example, in bank accounts or in securities. Let’s take 
Apple Computer Inc. as an example.
Table 2.1 presents a time line for Apple and examples of the sources of financing 
tapped by Apple from its start-up in a California garage in 1976 to its cash-rich status 
in 2016. The initial investment in Apple stock was $250,000. Apple was also able to 
get short-term financing from parts suppliers who did not demand immediate payment. 
Apple got the parts, assembled and sold the computers, and afterward paid off its 
accounts payable to the suppliers. (We discuss accounts payable in Chapter 19.) Then,
