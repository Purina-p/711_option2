xchange (NYSE) was founded in 1792 when a 
group of brokers met under a buttonwood tree* and 
arranged to trade shares with one another at agreed rates 
of commission. Today the NYSE is the largest stock 
exchange in the world, trading on average about 1.5 billion 
shares a day. (Chapter 7)
1929 Stock Market Crashes Common stocks are risky investments. In September 1929 stock prices in the United 
States reached an all-time high, and the economist Irving 
Fisher forecast that they were at “a permanently high plateau.” Some 3 years later, stock prices were almost 90% 
lower, and it was to be a quarter of a century before the 
prices of September 1929 were seen again. Eighty years 
later, history came close to repeating itself. After stock 
prices peaked in July 2007, they slumped over the next 20 
months by 54%. (Chapter 11)
1960s Eurodollar Market In the 1950s the Soviet Union transferred its dollar holdings from the United States to a 
Russian-owned bank in Paris. This bank was best known 
by its telex address, eurobank, and consequently dollars 
held outside the United States came to be known as eurodollars. In the 1960s, U.S. taxes and regulation made it 
much cheaper to borrow and lend dollars in Europe than in 
the United States, and a huge market in eurodollars arose.

1971 Corporate Bankruptcies Every generation of investors 
is shocked and surprised by a major corporate bankruptcy. 
In 1971 the Penn Central Railroad, a pillar of American 
industry, suddenly collapsed. At that time, it was the largest corporate bankruptcy in history. In 2008, the investment bank Lehman Brothers smashed Penn Central’s 
record. (Chapter 16)
1972 Financial Futures Financial futures allow companies to 
protect themselves against fluctuations in interest rates, 
exchange rates, and so on. It is said that they originated 
from a remark by the economist Milton Friedman that 
he was unable to profit from his view that sterling (the U.K. 
currency) was overpriced. The Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange founded the first financial futures market. 
Today futures exchanges trade 6 billion contracts a year of 
financial futures. (Chapter 24)
1986 Capital Investment Decisions The largest investment 
project undertaken by a single private company was the 
construction of the tunnel under the English Channel. This 
started in 1986 and was completed in 1994 at a total cost 
of $15 billion. The cost of the Gorgon natural gas project in 
Australia is estimated at $54 billion. (Chapters 8, 9)
1988 Mergers The 1980s saw a wave of takeovers culminating in the $25 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco. Over a
