company. As one of the contestants put it, “We were 
charging through the rice paddies, not stopping for 
anything and taking no prisoners.” The takeover was the 
largest in history and generated almost $1 billion in fees 
for the banks and advisers. (Chapter 21)
1993 Inflation Financial managers need to recognize the 
effect of inflation on interest rates and on the profitability 
of the firm’s investments. In the United States inflation has 
been relatively modest, but some countries have suffered 
from hyperinflation. In Hungary after World War II, the government issued banknotes worth 1,000 trillion pengoes. In 
Yugoslavia in October 1993, prices rose by nearly 2,000% 
and a dollar bought 105 million dinars. The inflation rate in 
Venezuela in late 2015 was about 180%. (Chapter 5)
1780 and 1997 Inflation-Indexed Debt In 1780, Massachusetts paid Revolutionary War soldiers with interest-bearing 
notes rather than its rapidly eroding currency. Interest and 
principal payments on the notes were tied to the subsequent rate of inflation. After a 217-year hiatus, the U.S. 
Treasury issued inflation-indexed notes called TIPS 
(Treasury Inflation Protected Securities). Many other countries, including Britain and Israel, had done so previously.

1993 Controlling Risk When a company fails to keep close 
tabs on the risks being taken by its employees, it can get 
into serious trouble. This was the fate of Barings, a 
220-year-old British bank that numbered the queen among 
its clients. In 1993 it discovered that Nick Leeson, a trader 
in its Singapore office, had hidden losses of $1.3 billion 
(£869 million) from unauthorized bets on the Japanese 
equity market. The losses wiped out Barings and landed 
Leeson in jail, with a 6-year sentence. In 2008 a rogue 
trader at Morgan Stanley established a new record by losing $9 billion on unauthorized deals. (Chapter 24)
1999 The Euro Large corporations do business in many 
currencies. In 1999 a new currency came into existence 
when 11 European countries adopted the euro in place of 
their separate currencies. They have since been joined by

SUMMARY
Financial management can be broken down into (1) the investment or capital budgeting 
decision and (2) the financing decision. The firm has to decide (1) which real assets to 
invest in and (2) how to raise the funds necessary to pay for those investments.
Real assets include all assets used in the production or sale of the firms’ products or 
services. They can be tangible (plant and equipment, for example) or intangible (patents 
or trademarks, for example). In contrast, financial assets (such as stocks or bonds) are 
claims on the income generated by real assets.
Corporations are distinct, permanent l
