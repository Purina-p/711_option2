edeem their shares for cash on short notice because the funds invest
in traded securities, which can be sold as necessary.
Of course, liquidity is a matter of degree. Foreign exchange markets for major currencies
are exceptionally liquid. Bank of America or Deutsche Bank could buy $200 million
worth of yen or euros in the blink of an eye, with hardly any effect on foreign exchange
rates. U.S. Treasury securities are also very liquid, and the shares of the largest companies
on the major international stock exchanges are only slightly less so.
Liquidity is most important when you’re in a hurry. If you try to sell $500,000
worth of the shares of a small, thinly traded company all at once, you will probably
knock down the price to some extent. If you’re patient and don’t surprise other investors
with a large, sudden sell order, you may be able to unload your shares on better
terms. It’s the same problem that you may face in selling real estate. A house or condominium
is not a liquid asset in a panic sale. If you’re determined to sell in an afternoon,
you’re not going to get full value.
The Payment Mechanism
Think how inconvenient life would be if you had to pay for every purchase in cash or
if Boeing had to ship truckloads of hundred-dollar bills around the country to pay its
suppliers. Checking accounts, credit cards, and electronic transfers allow individuals

15 Of course, the bank can’t repay all depositors simultaneously. To do so, it would have to sell off its loans to
the real estate developer and other borrowers. These loans are not liquid. This raises the specter of bank runs,
where doubts about a bank’s ability to pay off its depositors cause a rush of withdrawals, with each depositor
trying to get his or her money out first. Bank runs are rare because bank deposits are backed up by theTransporting Cash across Time
Individuals need to transport expenditures in time. If you have money now that you
wish to save for a rainy day, you can (for example) put the money in a savings account
at a bank and withdraw it with interest later. If you don’t have money today, say to buy
a car, you can borrow money from the bank and pay off the loan later. Modern finance
provides a kind of time machine. Lenders transport money forward in time; borrowers
transport it back. Both are happier than if they were forced to spend income as it
arrives. Of course, individuals are not alone in needing to raise cash from time to time.
Firms with good investment opportunities, but a shortage of internally generated cash,
raise cash by borrowing or selling new shares. Many governments run deficits and
finance current outlays by issuing debt.
Young people saving for retirement may transport their current earnings 30 or 40
years into the future by means of a pension fund. They can even transport income to
their heirs by purchase of a life insurance policy
