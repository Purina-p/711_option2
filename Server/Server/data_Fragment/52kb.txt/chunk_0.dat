n Chapter 1 we introduced the basic objective of
corporate finance: Maximize the current value of
shareholders’ investment in the firm. For public
corporations, this value is set in the stock market.
It equals market price per share multiplied by the
number of shares outstanding. Of course, the fluctuations
in market value partly reflect events that are
outside the manager’s control. Nevertheless, good
managers always strive to add value by superior investment
and financing decisions.
How can we judge whether managers are doing a
good job at adding value or where there may be scope
for improvement? We need measures of value added.
We also need measures that help explain where the
value added comes from. For example, value added
depends on profitability, so we need measures of profitability.
Profitability depends in turn on profit margins and
on how efficiently the firm uses its assets. We will
describe the standard measures of profitability and
efficiency in this chapter.
Value also depends on sound financing. Value is
destroyed if the firm is financed recklessly and can’t pay
its debts. Value is also destroyed if the firm does not
maintain adequate liquidity and therefore has difficulty
finding the cash to pay its bills. Therefore, we will
describe the measures that financial managers and
investors use to assess debt policy and liquidity.
These financial measures are mostly financial ratios
calculated from the firm’s income statement and balance
sheet. Therefore, we will have to take care to
remember the limitations of these accounting data.
You have probably heard stories of whizzes who can
take a company’s accounts apart in minutes, calculate a
list of financial ratios, and divine the company’s future.
Such people are like abominable snowmen: often
spoken of but never truly seen. Financial ratios are no
substitute for a crystal ball. They are just a convenient
way to summarize financial data and to assess and compare
financial performance. The ratios help you to ask
the right questions, but they seldom answer them.

88 Part One Introduction
How Financial Ratios Relate to Shareholder Value
The good news about financial ratios is that they are usually easy to calculate. The bad
news is that there are so many of them. To make it worse, the ratios are often presented
in long lists that seem to require memorization first and understanding maybe later.
We can mitigate the bad news by taking a moment to preview what the ratios are
measuring and how the ratios connect to the ultimate objective of value added for
shareholders.
Shareholder value depends on good investment decisions. The financial manager
