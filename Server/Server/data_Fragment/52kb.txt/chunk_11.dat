The consultancy firm EVA Dimensions calculates market value added for a large
sample of U.S. companies. Table 4.3 shows a few of the firms from EVA’s list. They
include some of the most and least successful companies. Apple heads the group.
It has created $627.6 billion of wealth for its shareholders. Bank of America languishes
near the bottom: The market value of its shares is $118 billion less than the
amount of shareholders’ money invested in the firm.
The top-listed companies in Table 4.3 are large firms. Their managers have lots
of assets to work with. A small firm could not hope to create so much extra value.
Therefore, financial managers and analysts also like to calculate how much value has
been added for each dollar that shareholders have invested. To do this, they compute
the ratio of market value to book value. For example, Home Depot’s market-to-book
ratio in early 2015 (at the end of its 2014 fiscal year) was2
Market-to-book ratio = _ m a_r_k_e_t _v_a_lu_e_ _o_f_ e_q_u_i_ty_
book value of equity
= _$1_4_9_,_9_7_8

Ratio of market value of

2 The market-to-book ratio can also be calculated by dividing stock price by book value per share.

In other words, Home Depot has multiplied the value of its shareholders’ investment
16.1 times.
Table 4.3 shows a sample of market-to-book ratios for 2014. Notice that
Coca-Cola has a much higher market-to-book ratio than ExxonMobil. But Exxon’s
market value added is higher because of its larger scale.
The market-value performance measures in Table 4.3 have three drawbacks. First,
the market value of the company’s shares reflects investors’ expectations about future
performance. Investors pay attention to current profits and investment, of course, but
they also avidly forecast investment and growth. Second, market values fluctuate
because of many risks and events that are outside the financial manager’s control.
Thus, market values are noisy measures of how well the corporation’s management is
performing. Third, you can’t l
