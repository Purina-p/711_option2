east dimly aware that
promoting and selling massive amounts of subprime MBSs was likely to end badly.
They didn’t wake up in the morning thinking, “Hey, maybe I can cause a financial
crisis,” but their incentives did call for trying to squeeze out one more fat bonus before
the game ended. Their incentives were not aligned withMortgage-backed securities (MBSs) provide another example
of how financial markets convey savings to finance
investment in real assets. In this case, the real assets
are homes, which homeowners finance in part with mortgage
loans.
In the old days—the 1960s, for example—most mortgage
loans were made by local banks, savings banks, and savings
and loan institutions (S&Ls), which accepted deposits and savings
accounts and made mortgage and other local loans. We
will use an S&L as the example. The flow of savings would be
as described by the figure in Panel a, at the bottom of this box.
The typical mortgage was long term, up to 30 years maturity,
with a fixed interest rate. The S&Ls’ liabilities—chiefly savings
accounts—had much shorter maturities, perhaps a year
or two on average. The S&Ls were therefore “borrowing
short, lending long,” a dangerous investment strategy. When
interest rates rose in the 1970s and 1980s, the S&Ls’ interest
costs on savings accounts rose, too, but their interest income
was locked up in long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. Losses
mounted. The S&L crisis of the 1980s followed.*
The invention of the MBS allowed S&Ls to eliminate the risks
of borrowing short and lending long. You can still get a mortgage
from your local S&L, but now the S&L does not have to keep it.
The S&L originates the mortgage, but will probably resell it to an
MBS issuer—for example, Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage
Association or FNMA†) or Bank of America. The issuer combines
your mortgage with hundreds or thousands of others and
issues an MBS backed by the combined portfolio. The MBS is
sold to investors such as life insurance companies that want to
hold long-term, fixed-rate obligations. Cash flows from the mortgage
portfolio are passed through to investors.‡
Suppose a life insurance company purchases an MBS. The
flow of savings would now match the figure in Panel b.

* For a history of the crisis, see Edward J. Kane, The S&L Insurance Mess: How
Did It Happen? (Washington, D.C.: Urban Institute Press, 1989).
† Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) are
government-sponsored entities (GSEs) charged with increasing the availability
of mortgage credit. The GSEs purchase “conforming loans” and package and
resell them as MBSs. Nonconforming loans—for example, large, “jumbo”
mortgages—are packaged by banks such as Citigroup or Bank of America.
‡ You still send monthly payments to your local S&L. The S&L extracts a small
servicing fee and sends your payments along to the MBS issuer, which also
extracts a small servicing fee. Net cash flows from the portfolio of mortgages
then go to the MBS investors.
