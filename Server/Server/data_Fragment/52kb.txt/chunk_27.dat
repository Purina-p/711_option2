end money and walk away. They monitor the
borrower to make sure that the loan is used for its intended purpose and that the borrower’s
credit stays solid.
Risk Transfer and Diversification
Financial markets and intermediaries allow investors and businesses to reduce
and reallocate risk. Insurance companies are an obvious example. When you buy
homeowner’s insurance, you greatly reduce the risk of loss from fire, theft, or accidents.
But your policy is not a very risky bet for the insurance company. It diversifies
by issuing thousands of policies, and it expects losses to average out over the policies.13
The insurance company allows you to pool risk with thousands of other homeowners.
Investors should diversify too. For example, you can buy shares in a mutual fund
that holds hundreds of stocks. In fact, you can buy index funds that invest in all the
stocks in the popular market indexes. For example, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund holds
the stocks in the Standard & Poor’s Composite stock market index. (The “S&P 500”
tracks the performance of the largest U.S. stocks. It is the index most used by professional
investors.) If you buy this fund, you are insulated from the company-specific
risks of the 500 companies in the index. These risks are averaged out by diversification.
Of course you are still left with the risk that the level of the stock market as a
whole will fall. In fact, we will see in Chapter 11 that investors are mostly concerned
with market risk, not the specific risks of individual companies.
Index mutual funds are one way to invest in widely diversified portfolios at l
