The widespread availability of mortgage finance fueled a dramatic increase in
house prices, which doubled in the 5 years ending June 2006. At that point, prices
started to slide and homeowners began to default on their mortgages. A year later,
Bear Stearns, a large investment bank, announced huge losses on the mortgage investments
that were held in two of its hedge funds. By the spring of 2008, Bear Stearns
was on the verge of bankruptcy, and the U.S. Federal Reserve arranged for it to be
acquired by JPMorgan Chase.
The crisis peaked in September 2008, when the U.S. government was obliged to take
over the giant federal mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which
had invested several hundred billion dollars in subprime mortgage-backed securities.
Over the next few days, the financial system started to melt down. Both Merrill Lynch
and Lehman Brothers were in danger of failing. On September 14, the government
arranged for Bank of America to take over Merrill in return for financial guarantees.
However, it did nothing to rescue Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy protection
the next day. Two days later, the government reluctantly lent $85 billion to the
giant insurance company AIG, which had insured huge volumes of mortgage-backed
securities and other bonds against default. The following day, the Treasury unveiled its
first proposal to spend $700 billion to purchase “toxic” mortgage-backed securities.
After the failure of Lehman and the forced rescues of Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac, Merrill Lynch, and AIG, investors and financial institutions had to ask, “Who will
be next? Do I dare trade with or lend money to Bank X?” In many situations, the cautious
answer was “No.” Customary day-to-day financial transactions were canceled or completed
on onerous terms.19 At the same time, trading in MBSs and other hard-to-value
securities dried up; it therefore became even harder to know what these securities were
worth. As banks and other financial institutions became reluctant to trade securities or
lend to one another, the supply of credit to the economy contracted and business investment
was cut back. The U.S. economy suffered one of its worst setbacks since the Great
Depression. Unemployment rose rapidly and business bankruptcies tripled.
