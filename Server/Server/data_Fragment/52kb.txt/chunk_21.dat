east estimate—the rates of return that investors can expect
on their savings. The information provided by financial markets is often essential to a
financial manager’s job. Here are three examples of how this information can be used.
Commodity Prices Catalytic converters are used in the exhaust systems of cars and
light trucks to reduce pollution. The catalysts include platinum, which is traded on the
New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
In March a manufacturer of catalytic converters is planning production for October.
How much per ounce should the company budget for purchases of platinum in that
month? Easy: The company’s CFO looks up the futures price of platinum on the New
York Mercantile Exchange—$972 per ounce for delivery in October (this was the
closing price for platinum in March 2016, for delivery in October). The CFO can lock
in that price if she wishes. The details of such a trade are covered in Chapter 24.
Interest Rates The CFO of Catalytic Concepts has to raise $400 million in new
financing. She considers an issue of long-term bonds. What will the interest rate on the
bonds be? To find out, the CFO looks up interest rates on existing bonds traded in
financial markets.
The results are shown in Table 2.2. Notice how the interest rate climbs as credit
quality deteriorates: The largest, safest companies, which are rated AAA (“triple-A”),
can raise long-term debt at a 2.59% interest rate. The interest rates for AA, A, and
BBB rise to 2.62%, 3.03%, and 4.32%, respectively. BBB companies are still regarded
as investment grade, that is, good quality, but the next step down takes the investor into
junk bond territory. The interest rate for BB debt climbs to 5.62%. Single-B companies
are riskier still, so investors demand 8.32%.
There will be more on bond ratings and interest rates in Chapter 6. But you can see
how a financial manager can use information from fixed-income markets to forecast
the interest rate on new debt financing. For example, if Catalytic Concepts can qualify
as a BBB-rated company, and interest rates are as shown in Table 2.2, it should be able
to raise new debt financing for approximately 4.32%.
Company Values How much was Callaway Golf worth in March 2016? How about
Alaska Air Group, Entergy, Yum! Brands, or GE? Table 2.3 shows the market capitalization
of each company. We simply multiply the number of shares outstanding by the
price per share in the stock market. Investors valued Callaway Golf at $821 million
and GE at $283 billion.

March 2016. The interest rate is
lowest for top-quality (AAA)
issuers. The rate rises as credit
quality declines.
Credit Rating Interest RateLiquidity
Markets and intermediaries also provide liquidity, that is, the ability to turn an investment
back into cash when needed. Suppose you deposit $5,000 in a savings bank on
February 1. During that month, the bank uses your deposit and other new deposits to
make a 6-month construction loan to a real estate developer. On March 1, you realize
that you need your $5,000 back. The bank can give it to you. Because the bank has
thousands of depositors, and other sources of financing if necessary, it can make an
illiquid loan to the developer financed by liquid deposits made by you and other customers.
If you lend your money for 6 months directly to the real estate developer, you
will have a hard time retrieving it 1 month later.15
The shares of public companies are liquid because they are traded more or less continuously
in the stock market. An Italian investor who puts $60,000 into Bank of
America shares can recover that money on short notice. (A $60,000 sell order is a drop
in the bucket compared with the normal trading volume of Bank of America shares.)
Mutual funds can redeem their shares for cash on short notice because the funds invest
in traded securities, which can be sold as necessary.
Of course, liquidity is a matter of degree. Foreign exchange markets for major currencies
are exceptionally liquid. Bank of America or Deutsche Bank could buy $200 million
worth of yen or euros in the blink of an eye, with hardly any effect on foreign exchange
rates. U.S. Treasury securities are also very liquid, and the shares of the largest companies
on the major international stock exchanges are only slightly less so.
Liquidity is most important when you’re in a hurry. If you try to sell $500,000
worth of the shares of a small, thinly traded company all at once, you will probably
knock down the price to some extent. If you’re patient and don’t surprise other investors
with a large, sudden sell order, you may be able to unload your shares on better
