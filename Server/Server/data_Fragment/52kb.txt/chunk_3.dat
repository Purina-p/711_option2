measures that the financial manager can use to answer the question. For example,
the bottom box on the far left of Figure 4.1 asks about efficient use of assets. Three
financial ratios that measure asset efficiency are turnover ratios for assets, inventory,
and accounts receivable.
The two bottom boxes on the right ask whether financial leverage (the amount of
debt financing) is prudent and whether the firm has enough liquidity for the coming
year. The ratios for tracking financial leverage include debt ratios, such as the ratio of
debt to equity, and interest coverage ratios. The ratios for liquidity are the current,
quick, and cash ratios.
