ook up the market value of privately owned companies
whose shares are not traded. Nor can you observe the market value of divisions or
plants that are parts of larger companies. You may use market values to satisfy yourself
that Home Depot as a whole has performed well, but you can’t use them to drill
down to compare the performance of the lumber and home improvement divisions.
To do this, you need accounting measures of profitability. We start with economic
value added (EVA).
Economic Value Added and Accounting
Rates of Return
When accountants draw up an income statement, they start with revenues and then
deduct operating and other costs. But one important cost is not included: the cost of
the capital the firm employs. Therefore, to see whether the firm has truly created
value, we need to measure whether it has earned a profit after deducting all costs,
including the cost of its capital.
Recall from Chapters 1 and 2 that the cost of capital is the minimum acceptable rate
of return on capital investment. It is an opportunity cost of capital because it equals the
expected rate of return on opportunities open to investors in financial markets.
The firm creates value only if it can earn more than its cost of capital, that is, more
than its investors can earn by investing on their own.
The profit after deducting all costs, including the cost of capital, is called the
company’s economic value added or EVA. The term “EVA” was coined by Stern
Stewart & Co., which did much to develop and promote the concept. EVA is also
called residual income.
In calculating EVA, it’s customary to take account of all the long-term capital contributed
by investors in the corporation. That means including bonds and other longterm
debt as well as equity capital. Total long-term capital, usually called total
capitalization, is the sum of long-term debt and shareholders’ equity.

control over its currency and could not just print more euros to service its debts. In
2011 it defaulted on debts totaling €100 billion.
Greece was still on shaky ground in early 2016, despite a series of rescue packages
from the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary
Fund. Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and other European countries that had also worried
investors avoided default and seemed to be recovering. But unemployment in many
European countries remained stubbornly high and economic growth anemic.
