essons can you, as a student of finance, draw from these financial crises?
Here are three. First, note the sorry consequences for the economy when financial
markets and institutions do not carry out the functions described in this chapter. For
example, the crisis was amplified by the sudden disappearance of liquidity in many
markets, including the market for MBSs. That meant that potential buyers of the illiquid
assets could not know for sure what they were worth. Thus, the informational function
of financial markets was also compromised.
Second, why were Bear Stearns, Lehman, Merrill Lynch, and the other distressed
firms so fragile? One reason is that they were mostly financed with borrowed money,
much of it short-term debt that had to be refinanced frequently. Investment banks like
Lehman typically were financed with more than 95% debt and less than 5% equity
capital. Thus a 5% fall in their asset values could wipe out their equity “cushions” and
leave the banks insolvent. Regulators since the crisis have therefore required banks to
finance with much more equity. This requirement has also affected payout to shareholders.
A U.S. bank’s dividend payments can be stopped by regulators if the bank’s
equity capital ratio is not up to snuff. We cover decisions about debt versus equity
financing and payout in Chapters 16 and 17.
Third, some causes of the crisis can be traced back to agency problems noted in
Chapter 1. Managers in the mortgage business were probably at l
