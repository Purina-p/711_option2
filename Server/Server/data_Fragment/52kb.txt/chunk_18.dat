that month’s interest on the loan. The unpaid interest was then added to the amount of the mortgage, so the
homeowner was burdened by an ever-increasing mortgage that one day would need to be paid off.
19 The interest rate on interbank loans rose in 2008 to 4.6%Stock prices and company values summarize investors’ collective assessment
of how well a company is doing, both its current performance and its future prospects.
Thus an increase in stock price sends a positive signal from investors to
managers.16 That is why top management’s compensation is linked to stock prices. A
manager who owns shares in his or her company will be motivated to increase the
company’s market value. This reduces agency costs by aligning the interests of managers
and stockholders.
This is one important advantage of going public. A private company can’t use its
stock price as a measure of performance. It can still compensate managers with shares,
but the shares will not be valued in a financial market.
Cost of Capital Financial managers look to financial markets to measure, or at
least estimate, the cost of capital for the firm’s investment projects. The cost of capital
is the minimum acceptable rate of return on the project. Investment projects offering
rates of return higher than their cost of capital are worthwhile because they add value;
they make both the firm and its shareholders better off financially. Projects offering
rates of return less than the cost of capital subtract value and should not be
undertaken.17
Thus the hurdle rate for investments inside the corporation is actually set outside
the corporation. The expected rate of return on investments in financial markets determines
the opportunity cost of capital.
The opportunity cost of capital is generally not the interest rate that the firm pays on
a loan from a bank or insurance company. If the company is making a risky investment,
the opportunity cost of capital is the expected rate of return that investors can
achieve in financial markets at the same level of risk. The expected rate of return on
risky securities is normally well above the interest rate on corporate borrowing.
We introduced the cost of capital in Chapter 1, but this brief reminder may help to
fix the idea. We cover the cost of capital in detail in Chapters 11 and 12.
