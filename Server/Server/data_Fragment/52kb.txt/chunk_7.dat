trying to decide whether to allocate $25 million of new money to Home Depot stock.
Perhaps you are a major shareholder pondering a sellout. You could be an investment
banker seeking business from Home Depot or a bondholder concerned with Home
Depot’s credit standing. You could be the treasurer or CFO of Home Depot or of
one of its competitors. You want to understand Home Depot’s value and financial
performance. How would you start?
Home Depot’s common stock closed fiscal 2014 at a price of $114.75 per share.
There were 1,307 million shares outstanding, so Home Depot’s market capitalization
or “market cap” was $114.75 × 1,307 = $149,978 million, or nearly $150 billion.
This is a big number, of course, but Home Depot is a big company. Home Depot’s
shareholders have, over the years, invested billions in the company. Therefore,
you decide to compare Home Depot’s market capitalization with the book value of
Home Depot’s equity. The book value measures shareholders’ cumulative investment
in the firm.
You turn to Home Depot’s income statement and balance sheet, which are reproduced
in Tables 4.1 and 4.2.1 At the end of 2014, the book value of Home Depot’s
equity was $9,322 million. Therefore, Home Depot’s market value added, the difference
between the market value of the firm’s shares and the amount of money that
shareholders have invested in the firm, was $149,978 − $9,322 = $140,656 million.
In other words, Home Depot shareholders have contributed about $9.3 billion
and ended up with shares worth almost $150 billion. They have accumulated $140.7
billion in market value added.
4.2
