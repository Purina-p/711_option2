as Apple grew, it was able to obtain several rounds of financing by selling Apple shares 
to private venture capital investors. (We discuss venture capital in Chapter 15.) In 
December 1980, it raised $91 million in an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares to 
public investors. There was also a follow-up share issue in May 1981.1
After Apple became a public company, it could raise financing from many sources, 
and it was able to pay for acquisitions by issuing more shares. We show a few examples in Table 2.1.
Apple started paying cash dividends to shareholders in 1987, and it also distributed 
cash to investors by stock repurchases in the early 1990s. But Apple hit a rough patch 
in 1996 and 1997, and regular dividends were eliminated. The company had to borrow 
$661 million from a group of private investors in order to cover its losses and finance 
its recovery plan. However, the rough patch ended with the release of the iMac in 1998 
and the iPod in 2001. Apple’s profitability increased rapidly, and it was able to finance 
its growth by plowing back earnings into operations. These retained earnings had 
grown to $92 billion by September 2015.
As the twenty-first century progressed, Apple’s profits grew so fast that it piled up 
a cash mountain, which grew to more than $200 billion by 2016. It resumed cash dividends and started a massive program of share repurchases. Its Capital Return Program, 
which began in 2012, will distribute $200 billion in cash to its shareholders by 2017.
Apple is well known for its product innovations, including the Macintosh computer, 
the iPhone, and the iPad. Apple is not special because of financing. In fact, the story of 
its financing is not too different from that of many other successful companies. But 
access to financing was vital to Apple’s growth and profitability. Would we have iMac 
computers, iPhones, or iPads if Apple had been forced to operate in a country with a 
primitive financial system? Definitely not. A prosperous economy requires a wellfunctioning financial system.
A modern financial system offers financing in many different forms, depending on 
the company’s age, its growth rate, and the nature of its business. For example, Apple 
relied on venture capital financing in its early years and only later floated its shares in 
public stock markets. Still later, as the company matured, it turned to other forms of 
financing, including the examples given in Table 2.1. But the table does not begin to 
cover the range of financing channels open to modern corporations. We will encounter 
many other channels later in the book, and new channels are opening up regularly. The 
nearby box describes one recent financial innovation, micro-lending funds that make 
small loans to businesspeople in the poorer parts of the world.
The Flow of Savings to Corporations
The money that corporations invest in real assets comes ultimately from savings 
by investors. But there can be many stops on the road between savings and corporate investment. The road can pass through financial markets, financial intermediaries, or both.
Let’s start with the simplest case of a small, closely held corporation, like Apple in 
its earliest years. The orange arrows in Figure 2.1 show the flow of savings from shareholders in this simple setting. There are two possible paths: The firm can sell new 
shares, or it can reinvest cash back into the firm’s operations. Reinvestment means 
additional savings by existing shareholders. The reinvested cash could have been paid 
out to those shareholders and spent by them on personal consumption. By not taking 
and spending the cash, shareholders have reinvested their savings in the corporation.

 Many of the shares sold in the 1981 issue were previously held by Apple employees. Sale of these shares 
allowed the employees to cash out and diversify some of their Apple holdings but did not raise additional 
financing for Apple.
