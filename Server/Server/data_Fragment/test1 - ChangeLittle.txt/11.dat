 shareholders.
Of course, a small corporation has other financing choices. It could take out a bank 
loan, for example. The bank in turn may have raised money by attracting savings 
accounts. In this case, investors’ savings flow through the bank to the firm.
Now consider a large, public corporation, for example, Apple Computer in 
September 2015. What’s different? Scale, for one thing: Apple’s annual revenues for 
the previous 12 months were $234 billion, and its balance sheet showed total assets of 
$290 billion. The scope of Apple’s activities has also expanded: It now has dozens of 
product lines and operates worldwide. Because of this scale and scope, Apple attracts 
investors’ savings by a variety of different routes. It can do so because it is a large, 
profitable, public firm.
The flow of savings to large public corporations is shown in Figure 2.2. Notice two 
key differences from Figure 2.1. First, public corporations can draw savings from investors worldwide. Second, the savings flow through financial markets, financial intermediaries, or both. Suppose, for example, that Bank of America raises $900 million by a 
new issue of shares. An Italian investor buys 4,000 of the new shares for $15 per share. 
Now Bank of America takes that $60,000, along with money raised by the rest of the 
issue, and makes a $300 million loan to Apple. The Italian investor’s savings end up 
flowing through financial markets (the stock market), to a financial intermediary (Bank 
of America), and finally to Apple.
Of course, our Italian friend’s $60,000 doesn’t literally arrive at Apple in an envelope marked “From L. DaVinci.” Investments by the purchasers of the Bank of 
America’s stock issue are pooled, not segreg
