s provide financing for business. They channel
savings to real investment. That much should be loud and clear from Sections 2.1 and
2.2 of this chapter. But there are other functions that may not be quite so
buy a fire insurance policy on your home. You pay cash to the insurance company
and get a financial asset (the policy) in exchange. You receive no interest payments on
this financial asset, but if a fire does strike, the company is obliged to cover the damages
up to the policy limit. This is the return on your investment. (Of course, a fire is a
sad and dangerous event that you hope to avoid. But if a fire does occur, you are better
off getting a payoff on your insurance policy than not having insurance at all.)
The company will issue not just one policy but thousands. Normally the incidence
of fires “averages out,” leaving the company with a predictable obligation to its policyholders
as a group. Of course, the insurance company must charge enough for its policies
to cover selling and administrative costs, pay policyholders’ claims, and generate
a profit for its stockholders.
Total Financing of U.S. Corporations
The pie chart in Figure 2.3 shows the investors in bonds and other debt securities.
Notice the importance of institutional investors—mutual funds, pension funds, insurance
companies, and banks. Households (individual investors) hold less than 5% of the
debt pie. The other slices represent the rest of the world (investors from outside the
United States) and other, smaller categories of investors.
The pie chart in Figure 2.4 shows holdings of the shares issued by U.S. corporaThe bank provides debt financing for the company and, at the same time, provides
a place for depositors to park their money safely and withdraw it as needed.
Investment Banks We have discussed commercial banks, which raise money from
depositors and other investors and then make loans to businesses and individuals.
Investment banks are different. Investment banks do not generally take deposits or
make loans to companies.10 Instead, they advise and assist companies in obtaining
finance. For example, investment banks underwrite stock offerings by purchasing the
new shares from the issuing company at a negotiated price and reselling the shares to
investors. Thus the issuing company gets a fixed price for the new shares, and the
investment bank takes responsibility for distributing the shares to investors. We discuss
share issues in more detail in Chapter 15.
Investment banks also advise on takeovers, mergers, and acquisitions. They offer
investment advice and manage investment portfolios for individual and institutional
investors. They run trading desks for foreign exchange, commodities, bonds, options,
and other derivatives.
Investment banks can invest their own money in start-ups and other ventures.
For example, the Australian Macquarie Bank has invested in airports, toll highways,
electric transmission andLike mutual funds, hedge funds also pool the savings of different investors and
invest on their behalf. But they differ from mutual funds in at least two ways. First,
because hedge funds usually follow complex, high-risk investment strategies, access is
usually restricted to knowledgeable investors such as pension funds, endowment funds,
and wealthy individuals. Don’t try to send a check for $3,000 or $5,000 to a hedge
fund; most hedge funds are not in the “retail” investment business. Second, hedge
funds try to attract the most talented managers by compensating them with potentially
lucrative, performance-related fees.4 In contrast, mutual funds usually charge a fixed
percentage of assets under management.
Hedge funds follow many different investment strategies. Some try to make a profit
by identifying overvalued stocks or markets and selling short. (We will not go into
procedures for short-selling here. Just remember that short-sellers profit when prices
fall.5) “Vulture funds” specialize in the securities of distressed corporations. Some
hedge funds take bets on firms involved in merger negotiations, others look for mispriced
convertible bonds, and some take positions in currencies and interest rates.

positions and have a large impact on the market.
There are other ways of pooling and investing savings. Consider a pension plan set
up by a corporation or other organization on behalf of its employees. There are several
types of pension plan. The most common type of plan is the defined-contribution plan.
In this case, a percentage of the employee’s monthly paycheck is contributed to a
pension fund. (The employer and employee may each contribute 5%, for example.)
Contributions from all participating employees are pooled and invested in securities or
mutual funds. (Usually the employees can choose from a menu of funds with different
investment strategies.) Each employee’s balance in the plan grows over the years as
contributions continue and investment income accumulates. The balance in the plan
can be used to finance living expenses after retirement. The amount available for
retirement depends on the accumulated contributions and on the rate of return earned
on the investments.6
Pension funds are designed for long-run investment. They provide professional
management and diversification. They also have an important tax advantage: Contributions
are tax-deductible, and investment returns inside the plan are not taxed until
cash is finally withdrawn.7
Pension plans are among the most important vehicles for savings. Total assets held
by U.S. pension plans were about $15 trillion inFinancial Intermediaries
A financial intermediary is an organization that raises money from investors and
provides financing for individuals, companies, and other organizations. For corporations,
intermediaries are important sources of financing. Intermediaries are a stop on
the road between savings and real investment.
Why is a financial intermediary different from a manufacturing corporation? First,
it may raise money in different ways, for example, by taking deposits or selling insurance
policies. Second, it invests that money in financial assets, for example, in stocks,
bonds, or loans to businesses or individuals. In contrast, a manufacturing company’s
main investments are in plant, equipment, or other real assets.
We will start with two important classes of intermediaries, mutual funds and pension
funds.
Mutual funds raise money by selling shares to investors. The investors’ money is
pooled and invested in a portfolio of securities. Investors can buy or sell shares in
mutual funds as they please, and initial investments are often $3,000 or less. Vanguard’s
Explorer Fund, for example, held a portfolio of more than 700 stocks with a
market value of about $10 billion in early 2016. An investor in Explorer can increase
her stake in the fund’s portfolio by buying additional shares, and so gain a higher share
of the portfolio’s subsequent dividends and price appreciation.2 She can also sell her
shares back to the fund if she decides to cash out of her investment.3
The advantages of a mutual fund should be clear: Unless you are very wealthy, you
cannot buy and manage a 700-stock portfolio on your own, at least not efficiently.
Mutual funds offer investors low-cost diversification and professional management.
For most investors, it’s more efficient to buy a mutual fund than to assemble
a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.
Most mutual fund managers also try their best to “beat the market,” that is, to generate
superior performance by finding the stocks with better-than-average returns. Whether
they can pick winners consistently is another question, which we address in Chapter 7.
In exchange for their services, the fund’s managers take out a management fee.
There are also the expenses of running the fund. For Explorer, fees and expenses
absorb about .5% of portfolio value each year. This seems reasonable, but watch out:
The typical mutual fund charges more than Explorer does. In some cases, fees and
expenses add up to 2% per year. That’s a big bite out of your investment return.
Mutual funds are a stop on the road from savings to corporate investment. Suppose
Explorer purchases part of the new issue of shares by Bank of America. Again weThese markets reveal the collective guess of traders on
issues as diverse as New York City snowfall, an avian flu outbreak,
and the occurrence of a major earthquake.
Prediction markets are conducted on a number of online
exchanges such as PredictIt (www.predictit.org) and Iowa Electronic
Markets (tippie.uiowa.edu/iem). Take the 2016 presidential
primaries as an example. On the Iowa Electronic Markets
you could have bet that Donald Trump would win the Republican
nomination by buying one of his contracts. Each Trump
contract promised to pay $1 if he won the nomination and nothing
if he lost. If you thought that the probability of a Trump victory
was 55% (say), you would have been prepared to pay up to
$.55 for his contract. Someone who was relatively pessimistic
about Trump’s chances would have been happy to sell you
such a contract because that sale would turn a profit if he were
to lose. With many participants buying and selling, the market
price of a contract revealed the collective wisdom of the crowd.
Take a look at the accompanying figure from the Iowa
Electronic Markets. It shows the contract prices for the various
contenders for the Republican nomination between JanuaryThe financial manager regularly encounters other financial markets. Here are three
examples, with references to the chapters where they are discussed:
∙ Foreign exchange markets (Chapter 22). Any corporation engaged in international
trade must be able to transfer money back and forth between dollars and other
currencies. Foreign exchange is traded over the counter through a network of the
largest international banks.
∙ Commodities markets (Chapter 24). Dozens of commodities are traded on organized
exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) or the Intercontinental

silver, platinum, and so on.
∙ Markets for options and other derivatives (Chapters 23 and 24). Derivatives are
securities whose payoffs depend on the prices of other securities or commodities.
For example, you can buy an option to purchase IBM shares at a
