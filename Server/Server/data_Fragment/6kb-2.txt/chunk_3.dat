Stock markets allow investors to bet on their favorite stocks. 
Prediction markets allow them to bet on almost anything else. 
These markets reveal the collective guess of traders on 
issues as diverse as New York City snowfall, an avian flu outbreak, and the occurrence of a major earthquake.
Prediction markets are conducted on a number of online 
exchanges such as PredictIt (www.predictit.org) and Iowa Electronic Markets (tippie.uiowa.edu/iem). Take the 2016 presidential primaries as an example. On the Iowa Electronic Markets 
you could have bet that Donald Trump would win the Republican nomination by buying one of his contracts. Each Trump 
contract promised to pay $1 if he won the nomination and nothing if he lost. If you thought that the probability of a Trump victory was 55% (say), you would have been prepared to pay up to 
$.55 for his contract. Someone who was relatively pessimistic 
about Trump’s chances would have been happy to sell you 
such a contract because that sale would turn a profit if he were 
to lose. With many participants buying and selling, the market 
price of a contract revealed the collective wisdom of the crowd.
Take a look at the accompanying figure from the Iowa 
Electronic Markets. It shows the contract prices for the various 
contenders for the Republican nomination between January 
and May 2016. You can see that as Ted Cruz beat Trump in a 
series of primaries and caucuses during March, the price of

Commodity and derivative markets are not sources of financing but markets where 
the financial manager can adjust the firm’s exposure to business risks. For example, an 
electric generating company may wish to lock in the future price of natural gas by trading in commodity markets, thus eliminating the risk of a sudden jump in the price of 
its raw materials.
Wherever there is uncertainty, investors may be interested in trading, either to speculate or to lay off their risks, and a market may arise to meet that trading
