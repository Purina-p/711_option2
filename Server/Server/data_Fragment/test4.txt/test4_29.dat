.
In principle, individuals or firms with cash surpluses could take out newspaper 
advertisements or surf the web looking for counterparties with cash shortages. But it is 
usually cheaper and more convenient to use financial markets and intermediaries. It is 
not just a matter of avoiding the cost of searching for the right counterparty. Follow-up 
is needed. For example, banks don’t just lend money and walk away. They monitor the 
borrower to make sure that the loan is used for its intended purpose and that the borrower’s credit stays solid.
Risk Transfer and Diversification
Financial markets and intermediaries allow investors and businesses to reduce 
and reallocate risk. Insurance companies are an obvious example. When you buy 
homeowner’s insurance, you greatly reduce the risk of loss from fire, theft, or accidents. But your policy is not a very risky bet for the insurance company. It diversifies 
by issuing thousands of policies, and it expects losses to average out over the policies.13
The insurance company allows you to pool risk with thousands of other homeowners.
Investors should diversify too. For example, you can buy shares in a mutual fund 
that holds hundreds of stocks. In fact, you can buy index funds that invest in all the 
stocks in the popular market indexes. For example, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund holds 
the stocks in the Standard & Poor’s Composite stock market index. (The “S&P 500” 
tracks the performance of the largest U.S. stocks. It is the index most used by professional investors.) If you buy this fund, you are insulated from the company-specific 
risks of the 500 companies in the index. These risks are averaged out by diversification. Of course you are still left with the risk that the level of the stock market as a 
whole will fall. In fact, we will see in Chapter 11 that investors are mostly concerned 
with market risk, not the specific risks of individual companies.
Index mutual funds are one way to invest in widely diversified portfolios at low 
cost. Another route is provided by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are portfolios 
of stocks that can be bought or sold in a single trade. For example, Standard & Poor’s 
Depositary Receipts (SPDRs, or “spiders”) invest in portfolios that match Standard & 
Poor’s stock market indexes. The total amount invested in the spider that tracks the 
benchmark S&P 500 index was $134 billion in early 2016.
ETFs are in some ways more efficient than mutual funds. To buy or sell an ETF, 
you simply make a trade, just as if you bought or sold shares of stock.14  This is 
13 Unfortunately for insurance companies, the losses don’t always average out. Hurricanes and earthquakes can 
damage thousands of homes at once. The potential losses are so great that property insurance companies buy 
reinsurance against such catastrophes.
14 ETFs are in this respect like closed-end mutual funds (see footnote 3). But ETFs do not have managers with 
the discretion to try to “pick winners.” ETF portfolios are tied down to indexes or fixed baskets of securities. 
ETF issuers make sure that the ETF price tracks the price of the underlying index or basket.

different from investing in an open-end mutual fund. In that case you have to send 
money to the fund in exchange for newly issued shares. And, if you want to withdraw 
the investment, you have to notify the fund, which redeems your shares and sends you 
a check. Also, many of the larger ETFs charge lower fees than mutual funds. State 
Street Global Advisors charges just .11% a year for managing the Standard & Poor’s 
500 Index Spider. For a $100,000 investment, the fee is only .0011 × 100,000 = $110.
Financial markets provide other mechanisms for sharing risks. For example, a 
wheat farmer and a baking company are each exposed to fluctuations in the price of 
wheat after the harvest. The farmer worries about low prices, the baker about high 
prices. They can both rest easier if the baker can agree with the farmer to buy wheat in 
the future at a fixed price. Of course, it would be difficult, to say the least, if the baker 
and the farmer had to contact an Internet dating service to get together to make a deal. 
Fortunately, no dating service is needed: Each can trade in commodity markets, the 
farmer as a seller and the baker as a buyer.
Liquidity
Markets and intermediaries also provide liquidity, that is, the ability to turn an investment back into cash when needed. Suppose you deposit $5,000 in a savings bank on 
February 1. During that month, the bank uses your deposit and other new deposits to 
make a 6-month construction loan to a real estate developer. On March 1, you realize 
that you need your $5,000 back. The bank can give it to you. Because the bank has 
thousands of depositors, and other sources of financing if necessary, it can make an 
illiquid loan to the developer financed by liquid deposits made by you and other customers. If you lend your money for 6 months directly to the real estate developer, you 
will have a hard time retrieving it 1 month later.15
The shares of public companies are liquid because they are traded more or less continuously in the stock market. An Italian investor who puts $60,000 into Bank of 
America shares can recover that money on short notice. (A $60,000 sell order is a drop 
in the bucket compared with the normal trading volume of Bank of America shares.) 
Mutual funds can redeem their shares for cash on short notice because the funds invest 
in traded securities, which can be sold as necessary.
Of course, liquidity is a matter of degree. Foreign exchange markets for major currencies are exceptionally liquid. Bank of America or Deutsche Bank could buy $200 million 
worth of yen or euros in the blink of an eye, with hardly any effect on foreign exchange 
rates. U.S. Treasury securities are also very liquid, and the shares of the largest companies on the major international stock exchanges are only slightly less so.
Liquidity is most important when you’re in a hurry. If you try to sell $500,000 
worth of the shares of a small, thinly traded company all at once, you will probably 
knock down the price to some extent. If you’re patient and don’t surprise other investors with a large, sudden sell order, you may be able to unload your shares on better 
terms. It’s the same problem that you may face in selling real estate. A house or condominium is not a liquid asset in a panic sale. If you’re determined to sell in an afternoon, you’re not going to get full value.
The Payment Mechanism
Think how inconvenient life would be if you had to pay for every purchase in cash or 
if Boeing had to ship truckloads of hundred-dollar bills around the country to pay its 
suppliers. Checking accounts, credit cards, and electronic transfers allow individuals 
liquidity
The ability to sell an asset 
on short notice at close to 
the market value.
15 Of course, the bank can’t repay all depositors simultaneously. To do so, it would have to sell off its loans to 
the real estate developer and other borrowers. These loans are not liquid. This raises the specter of bank runs, 
where doubts about a bank’s ability to pay off its depositors cause a rush of withdrawals, with each depositor 
trying to get his or her money out first. Bank runs are rare because bank deposits are backed up by the U.S. 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures bank accounts up to $250,000 per account.

and firms to send and receive payments quickly and safely over long distances. Banks 
are the obvious providers of payment services, but they are not alone. For example, if 
you buy shares in a money market mutual fund, your money is pooled with that of 
other investors and used to buy safe, short-term securities. You can then write checks 
on this mutual fund investment, just as if you had a bank deposit.
Information Provided by Financial Markets
In well-functioning financial markets, you can see what securities and commodities are 
worth, and you can see—or at least estimate—the rates of return that investors can expect 
on their savings. The information provided by financial markets is often essential to a 
financial manager’s job. Here are three examples of how this information can be used.
Commodity Prices Catalytic converters are used in the exhaust systems of cars and 
light trucks to reduce pollution. The catalysts include platinum, which is traded on the 
New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
In March a manufacturer of catalytic converters is planning production for October. 
How much per ounce should the company budget for purchases of platinum in that 
month? Easy: The company’s CFO looks up the futures price of platinum on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange—$972 per ounce for delivery in October (this was the 
closing price for platinum in March 2016, for delivery in October). The CFO can lock 
in that price if she wishes. The details of such a trade are covered in Chapter 24.
Interest Rates The CFO of Catalytic Concepts has to raise $400 million in new 
financing. She considers an issue of long-term bonds. What will the interest rate on the 
bonds be? To find out, the CFO looks up interest rates on existing bonds traded in 
financial markets.
The results are shown in Table 2.2. Notice how the interest rate climbs as credit 
quality deteriorates: The largest, safest companies, which are rated AAA (“triple-A”), 
can raise long-term debt at a 2.59% interest rate. The interest rates for AA, A, and 
BBB rise to 2.62%, 3.03%, and 4.32%, respectively. BBB companies are still regarded 
as investment grade, that is, good quality, but the next step down takes the investor into 
junk bond territory. The interest rate for BB debt climbs to 5.62%. Single-B companies 
are riskier still, so investors demand 8.32%.
There will be more on bond ratings and interest rates in Chapter 6. But you can see 
how a financial manager can use information from fixed-income markets to forecast 
the interest rate on new debt financing. For example, if Catalytic Concepts can qualify 
as a BBB-rated company, and interest rates are as shown in Table 2.2, it should be able 
to raise new debt financing for approximately 4.32%.
Company Values How much was Callaway Golf worth in March 2016? How about 
Alaska Air Group, Entergy, Yum! Brands, or GE? Table 2.3 shows the market capitalization of each company. We simply multiply the number of shares outstanding by the 
price per share in the stock market. Investors valued Callaway Golf at $821 million 
and GE at $283 billion.
TABLE 2.2 Interest rates on 
long-term corporate bonds, 
March 2016. The interest rate is 
lowest for top-quality (AAA) 
issuers. The rate rises as credit 
quality declines.

Stock prices and company values summarize investors’ collective assessment 
of how well a company is doing, both its current performance and its future prospects. Thus an increase in stock price sends a positive signal from investors to 
managers.16 That is why top management’s compensation is linked to stock prices. A 
manager who owns shares in his or her company will be motivated to increase the 
company’s market value. This reduces agency costs by aligning the interests of managers and stockholders.
This is one important advantage of going public. A private company can’t use its 
stock price as a measure of performance. It can still compensate managers with shares, 
but the shares will not be valued in a financial market.
Cost of Capital Financial managers look to financial markets to measure, or at 
least estimate, the cost of capital for the firm’s investment projects. The cost of capital 
is the minimum acceptable rate of return on the project. Investment projects offering 
rates of return higher than their cost of capital are worthwhile because they add value; 
they make both the firm and its shareholders better off financially. Projects offering 
rates of return less than the cost of capital subtract value and should not be 
undertaken.17
Thus the hurdle rate for investments inside the corporation is actually set outside 
the corporation. The expected rate of return on investments in financial markets determines the opportunity cost of capital.
The opportunity cost of capital is generally not the interest rate that the firm pays on 
a loan from a bank or insurance compan
