den of meeting detailed, inflexible regulations are pushing some corporations to return from public to private ownership. 
Some blame SOX and onerous regulation in the United States for the fact that an 
increasing number of foreign companies have chosen to list their shares in London 
rather than New York.
There is also a vigorous debate over “rules-based” versus “principles-based” 
approaches to accounting standards. The United States follows a rules-based approach, 
companies must be ready to defend their accounting practices in light of the general principles laid out in the IFRS. 
By contrast, in the United States, GAAP are accompanied by 
thousands of pages of prescriptive regulatory guidance 
and interpretations from auditors and accounting groups. 
For example, more than 160 pieces of authoritative literature 
relate to how and when companies record revenue. This 
leaves less room for judgment, but detailed rules rapidly 
become out of date, and unscrupulous companies have been 
able to structure transactions so that they keep to the letter 
but not the spirit of the rules.
By 2014, it had become clear that the SEC’s plan to move 
to IFRS was effectively dead and that, while the SEC and IASB 
would continue to collaborate on accounting rules, there was 
little prospect of any agreement over a single global standard 
that included the United States.
The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which 
are set by the London-based International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB), aim to harmonize financial reporting 
around the world. They are the basis for reporting throughout 
the European Union. In addition, some 100 other countries, 
such as Australia, Canada, Brazil, India, and China, have 
adopted them or plan to do so.
For some years, the SEC has worked to bring U.S. accounting standards more in line with international rules. For example, until 2007 foreign companies that traded on U.S. stock 
exchanges were required to show how their accounts differed from U.S. GAAP. This was a very expensive exercise 
that cost some companies millions of dollars annually and 
caused many to delist their stocks. These companies can 
now simply report results using international accounting standards. Subsequently, in August 2008, the SEC released its 
plans to allow some large U.S. multinationals, representing 
approximately $2.5 trillion in market capitalization, to eventually use IFRS for financial statements.
This shift from GAAP to IFRS would involve a major change 
in the way that accountants in the United States approach 
their task. IFRS tend to be “principles-based,” which means 
that there are no hard-and-fast codes to follow. Instead,

with detailed rules governing virtually every circumstance that possibly can be anticipated. In contrast, the European Union takes a principles-based approach to accounting. Its International Financial Reporting Standards set out general approaches that 
financial statements should take to valuing assets. Europe and the United States have 
been engaged for years in attempts to coordinate their systems, and many in the United 
States have lobbied for the greater simplicity that principles-based accounting 
standards might offer. The nearby box reports on these efforts.
Taxes
Taxes often have a major effect on financial decisions. Therefore, we should explain 
how corporations and investors are taxed.
Corporate Tax
Companies pay tax on their income. Table 3.5 shows that there are special low rates of 
corporate tax for small companies, but for large companies (those with income over 
$18.33 million) the corporate tax rate is 35%.12 Thus for every $100 that the firm earns 
it pays $35 in corporate tax.
When firms calculate taxable income, they are allowed to deduct expenses. These 
expenses include an allowance for depreciation. However, the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) specifies the rates of depreciation that the company can use for different 
types of equipment. The rates of depreciation used to calculate taxes are not the same 
as the rates used when the firm reports its profits to shareholders.13
The company is also allowed to deduct interest paid to debtholders when calculating its taxable income, but dividends paid to shareholders are not deductible. These 
dividends are therefore paid out of after-tax income. Table 3.6 provides an example of 
how interest payments reduce corporate taxes. Although EBIT for both firms A and B

TABLE 3.6 Firms A and B both 
have earnings before interest 
and taxes (EBIT) of $100 million, 
but A pays out part of its profits 
as debt interest. This reduces the 
corporate tax paid by A.
Note: Figures in millions of dollars.
12 In addition, corporations pay state income taxes, which we ignore here for simplicity.
13 If the company assumes a slower rate of depreciation in its income statement than the Internal Revenue 
Service assumes, the tax charge shown in the income statement will be higher in the early years of a project’s 
life than the actual tax payment. This difference is recorded in the balance sheet as a liability for deferred tax. 
We will tell you more about depreciation allowances in Chapter 9.

is $100 million, firm A, which has $40 million of interest expense, has lower pretax 
income and therefore pays less taxes.
The bad news about taxes is that each extra dollar of revenue increases taxable 
income by $1 and results in 35 cents of extra taxes. The good news is that each extra 
dollar of expense reduces taxable income by $1 and therefore reduces taxes by 
35 cents. For example, if the firm borrows money, every dollar of interest it pays on 
the loan reduces taxes by 35 cents. Therefore, a dollar of interest reduces after-tax 
income by only 65 cents.
14 Losses can be carried back for a maximum of 3 years and forward for up to 15 years.

TABLE 3.7 Personal tax 
rates, 2016
When firms make profits, they pay 35% of the profits to the Internal Revenue 
Service. But the process doesn’t work in reverse; if the firm suffers a loss, the IRS does 
not send it a check for 35% of the loss. However, the firm can carry the losses back, 
deduct them from taxable income in earlier years, and claim a refund of past taxes. 
Losses can also be carried forward and deducted from taxable income in the future.14
Personal Tax
Table 3.7 shows the U.S. rates of personal tax. Notice that as income increases, the 
tax rate also increases. Notice also that the top personal tax rate is higher than the top 
corporate rate.
The tax rates presented in Table 3.7 are marginal tax rates. The marginal tax rate 
is the tax that the individual pays on each extra dollar of income. For example, as a 
single taxpayer, you would pay 10 cents of tax on each extra dollar you earn when your 
income is below $9,275, but once income exceeds $9,275, you would pay 15 cents of 
tax on each extra dollar of income up to an income of $37,650. If your total income is 
$50,000, your tax bill is 10% of the first $9,275 of income, 15% of the next $28,375 
(i.e., 37,650 − 9,275), and 25% of the remaining $12,350:
Tax = (.10 × $9,275) + (.15 × $28,375) + (.25 × $12,350) = $8,271.25
marginal tax rate
Additional taxes owed per 
dollar of additional income.
Recalculate the figures in Table 3.6, assuming that firm A now has to make interest payments of $60 million. What happens to taxes paid? Does net income fall 
by the additional $20 million interest payment compared with the case considered in Table 3.6, where interest expense was only $40 million?

The average tax rate is simply the total tax bill divided by total income. In this 
example it is $8,271.25/$50,000 = .165, or 16.5%. Notice that the average rate is lower 
than the marginal rate. This is because of the lower rates on the first $37,650.

Average and 
marginal tax rates
The tax rates in Table 3.7 apply to “ordinary income,” primarily income earned as 
salary or wages. Interest earnings also are treated as ordinary income.
The U.S. government also taxes investment earnings, for example dividends or 
capital gains. The treatment of dividend income in the United States leads to what is 
commonly dubbed the “double taxation” of corporate earnings. Each dollar the company earns is taxed at the corporate rate. Then, if the company pays a dividend out of 
this after-tax income, the shareholder pays personal income taxes on the distribution. 
The original earnings are taxed first as corporate income and again as dividend income. 
Suppose instead that the company earns a dollar which is paid out as interest. The dollar escapes corporate tax because the interest payment is considered a business expense 
that reduces the firm’s taxable income.
Capital gains are also taxed, but only when the gains are realized. Suppose that you 
bought Bio-technics stock when it was selling for 10 cents a share. Its market price 
today is $1 a share. As long as you hold on to your stock, there is no tax to pay on your 
gain. But if you sell, the 90 cents of capital gain is taxed. 
Table 3.8 shows tax rates on investment income. For most investors, the effective 
tax rate is either 15% or 18.8% (15% plus a potential 3.8% surcharge), but the highest 
income investors pay an effective rate of 23.8%.
Financial managers need to worry about the tax treatment of investment income 
because tax policy will affect the prices individuals are willing to pay for the company’s stock or bonds. We will return to these
