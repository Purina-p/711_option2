Liquidity
Markets and intermediaries also provide liquidity, that is, the ability to turn an investment back into cash when needed. Suppose you deposit $5,000 in a savings bank on 
February 1. During that month, the bank uses your deposit and other new deposits to 
make a 6-month construction loan to a real estate developer. On March 1, you realize 
that you need your $5,000 back. The bank can give it to you. Because the bank has 
thousands of depositors, and other sources of financing if necessary, it can make an 
illiquid loan to the developer financed by liquid deposits made by you and other customers. If you lend your money for 6 months directly to the real estate developer, you 
will have a hard time retrieving it 1 month later.15
