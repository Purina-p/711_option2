computer chips at a cost of $800 million. The book value of the plant is $800 million 
less accumulated depreciation. But suppose that shortly after the plant is constructed, 
a new chip makes the existing one obsolete. The market value of Intel’s new plant 
could fall by 50% or more. In this case, market value would be less than book value.
The difference between book value and market value is greater for some assets than 
for others. It is zero in the case of cash but potentially very large for fixed assets where 
the accountant starts with initial cost and then depreciates that figure according to a 
prespecified schedule. The purpose of depreciation is to allocate the original cost of 
the asset over its life, and the rules governing the depreciation of asset values do not 
reflect actual loss of market value. Usually the market value of fixed assets is much 
higher than the book value, but sometimes it is less.
