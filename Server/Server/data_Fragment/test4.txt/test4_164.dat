 invest 
for tuition bills in the distant future. Their concern should be only with the risk and expected 
return of the shares. If a particular stock pays a generous cash dividend, they always have 
the option of reinvesting the dividend in that stock or, for that matter, in other securities. 
The dividend payout does not affect their ability to redirect current investment income to 
their future needs as they plan for their anticipated tuition bills.
1.5 Because investors can reasonably expect a 15% return in other investments in palladium, 
the firm should take this as the opportunity cost of capital for its proposed investment. 
Although the project is expected to show an accounting profit, its expected return is only 12%. 
Therefore, the firm should reject the project: Its expected return is less than the 15% expected 
return offered by equivalent-risk investments.
1.6 Agency problems arise when managers and shareholders have different objectives. Managers 
may empire-build with excessive investment and growth. Managers may be unduly riskaverse, or they may try to take excessive salaries or perquisites.
1.7 Harry’s has a far bigger stake in the reputation of its business than Victor’s. The store has been 
in business for a long time. The owners have spent years establishing customer loyalty. 
In contrast, Victor’s has just been established. The owner has little of his own money tied up 
in the firm, and so has little to lose if the business fails. In addition, the nature of the business 
results in little customer loyalty. Harry’s is probably more reliable.

f a corporation needs to issue more shares of stock, 
then its financial manager had better understand how 
the stock market works. If it wants to take out a bank 
loan, the financial manager had better understand how 
banks and other financial institutions work. If the firm 
contemplates a capital investment, such as a factory 
expansion or a new product launch, the financial manager needs to think clearly about the cost of the capital 
that the firm raises from outside investors. As we pointed 
out in Chapter 1, the opportunity cost of capital for the 
firm is the rate of return that its stockholders expect to 
get by investing on their own in financial markets. This 
means that the financial manager must understand how 
prices are determined in
