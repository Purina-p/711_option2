ant to estimate separately the value 
today of the van, but this would be costly and somewhat subjective. Accountants rely 
instead on rules of thumb to estimate the depreciation in the value of assets, and with 
rare exceptions they stick to these rules. For example, in the case of that delivery van, 
the accountant may deduct a third of the original cost each year to reflect its declining 
value. So if Home Depot bought the van 2 years ago for $15,000, the balance sheet 
would show that accumulated depreciation is 2 × $5,000 = $10,000. Net of depreciation the value is only $5,000. Table 3.1 shows that Home Depot’s total accumulated
