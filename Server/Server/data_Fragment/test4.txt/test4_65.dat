that you raise cash by selling other assets—your car or house, for example—in order to repay 
the loan. But if you incorporate the restaurant business, and then the corporation borrows 
from the bank, your other assets are shielded from the restaurant’s debts. Of course, 
incorporation also means that the bank will be more cautious in lending, because the bank 
will have no recourse to your other assets.5
Notice that if you incorporate your business, you exchange direct ownership of its real 
assets (the building, kitchen equipment, etc.) for indirect ownership via financial assets 
(the shares of the new corporation). ■

 The bank may ask you to put up personal assets as collateral for the loan to your restaurant corporation. But it 
has to ask and get your agreement. It doesn’t have to ask if your business is a sole proprietorship.

 The U.S. tax system is somewhat unusual in this respect. To avoid taxing the same income twice, many other 
countries give shareholders at least some credit for the taxes that the corporation has already paid.
