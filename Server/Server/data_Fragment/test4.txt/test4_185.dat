Commodity and derivative markets are not sources of financing but markets where 
the financial manager can adjust the firm’s exposure to business risks. For example, an 
electric generating company may wish to lock in the future price of natural gas by trading in commodity markets, thus eliminating the risk of a sudden jump in the price of 
its raw materials.
Wherever there is uncertainty, investors may be interested in trading, either to speculate or to lay off their risks, and a market may arise to meet that trading demand. In 
recent years, several smaller markets have been created that allow punters to bet on a 
single event. The nearby box discusses how prices in these markets can reveal people’s 
predictions about the future.

the road between savings and real investment.
Why is a financial intermediary different from a manufacturing corporation? First, 
it may raise money in different ways, for example, by taking deposits or selling insurance policies. Second, it invests that money in financial assets, for example, in stocks, 
bonds, or loans to businesses or individuals. In contrast, a manufacturing company’s 
main investments are in plant, equipment, or other real assets.
We will start with two important classes of intermediaries, mutual funds and pension funds.
Mutual funds raise money by selling shares to i
