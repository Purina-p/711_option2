$6,345 million that was left over after paying interest and taxes belonged 
to the shareholders. Of this sum, Home Depot paid out $2,530 million in dividends 
and reinvested the remaining $3,815 million in the business. Presumably, these reinvested funds made the company more valuable.
The $3,815 of earnings that Home Depot retained and reinvested in the firm show 
up on its balance sheet as an increase in retained earnings. Notice that retained earnings in Table 3.1 increased by $3,815 million in 2014, from $23,180 million to $26,995 
million. However, shareholders’ equity fell during the year because Home Depot also 
repurchased some of its stock.
Just as it is sometimes useful to prepare a common-size balance sheet, we can also 
prepare a common-size income statement. In this case, all items are expressed as a 
percentage of revenues. The last column of Table 3.3 is Home Depot’s common-size 
income statement. You can see, for example, that the cost of goods sold consumed 
65.2% of revenues and that selling, general, and administrative expenses absorbed a 
further 20.1%.
Income versus Cash Flow
It is important to distinguish between Home Depot’s income and the cash that the 
company generated. Here are two reasons that income and cash are not the same:
1. Depreciation. When Home Depot’s accountants prepare the income statement, they 
do not simply count the cash coming in and the cash going out. Instead, the 
accountant starts with the cash payments but then divides these payments into two
