If the firm’s operations can’t generate enough income to repay the bank, the 
bank can force the firm into bankruptcy and stake a claim on its real assets. Financial 
assets that can be purchased and traded by investors in public markets are called securities. The shares of stock issued by the public corporations in Table 1.1 are all securities. 
Entergy’s 10-year bond in Table 1.1 is a security. But a bank loan from JPMorgan to 
Entergy is not called a security unless the bank resells the loan to public investors.
The firm can issue an almost endless variety of financial assets. Suppose it decides 
to borrow. It can issue debt to investors, or it can borrow from a bank. It can borrow for 
1 year or 20 years. If it borrows for 20 years, it can reserve the right to pay off the debt 
early if interest rates fall. It can borrow in Paris, receiving and promising to repay 
euros, or it can borrow dollars in New York. (As Table 1.1 shows, Ford chose to borrow U.S. dollars, but it could have borrowed euros or Japanese yen instead.)
In some ways, financing decisions are less important than investment decisions. 
Financial managers say that “value comes mainly from the investment side of the balance sheet.” Also, the most successful corporations sometimes have the simplest 
financing strategies. Take Microsoft as an example. It is one of the world’s most valuable corporations. In early 2016, Microsoft shares traded for $53 each. There were 7.91
