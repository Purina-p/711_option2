0. Therefore, to go from the sales shown in the income 
statement to the cash inflows, we need to subtract the investment in receivables:
Period: 2 3
 Sales (income statement) 100 0
− Investment in receivables (balance sheet) 100 −100
= Cash received 0 +100
We will return to these issues in more detail in Chapter 9, but for now we summarize the key points as follows: Cash outflow is equal to the cost of goods sold, which is 
shown in the income statement, plus the change in inventories. Cash inflow is equal to 
the sales shown in the income statement less the change in uncollected bills.
Profits versus Cash Flows
Suppose our manufacturer spends a further $80 to produce goods in period 2. It sells these 
goods in period 3 for $120, but customers do not pay their bills until period 4.
The cash flows from these transactions are now as follows:
Example 3.2 ⊲
Period: 1 2 3
 Cost of goods sold (income statement) 0 60 80
+ Investment in inventories (balance sheet) 60 −60 + 80 = 20 −80
= Cash paid out 60 80 0
$100
(collect payment)
$120
(collect further payment)
-$60
(pay for goods) -$80
(pay for more goods)
1 2 3 4 Period
How do the new transactions affect the income statement and the balance sheet? 
The income statement will match costs with revenues and record the cost of goods sold 
when the sales are made in periods 1 and 2. The difference between the costs shown in the 
income statement and the cash flows is recorded as an investment (and later, disinvestment) 
in inventories. Thus, in period 1 the accountant shows an investment in inventories of 
$60 just as before. In period 2, these goods are taken out of inventory and sold, but the firm 
also produces a further $80 of goods. Thus, there is a net increase in inventories of $20. 
As these goods in turn are sold in period 3, inventories are reduced by $80. The following 
table confirms that the cash outflow in each period is equal to the cost of goods sold that is 
shown in the income statement plus the change in inventories.

The Statement of Cash Flows
The firm requires cash when it buys new plant and machinery or when it pays interest 
to the bank and dividends to the shareholders. Therefore, the financial manager needs
