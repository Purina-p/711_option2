To grow from small beginnings to a major corporation, FedEx needed to make good investment and financing decisions.

To carry on business, a corporation needs an 
almost endless variety of assets. Some are tangible assets such as plant and machinery, office 
buildings, and vehicles; others are intangible assets 
such as brand names and patents. Corporations finance 
these assets by borrowing, by reinvesting profits back 
into the firm, and by selling additional shares to the 
firm’s shareholders.
Financial managers, therefore, face two broad questions. First, what investments should the corporation 
make? Second, how should it pay for these investments? 
Investment decisions spend money. Financing decisions raise money for investment.
We start this chapter with examples of recent investment and financing decisions by major U.S. and foreign 
corporations. We review what a corporation is and 
describe the roles of its top financial managers. We then 
turn to the financial goal of the corporation, which is 
usually expressed as maximizing value, or at least 
adding value. Financial managers add value whenever 
the corporation can invest to earn a higher return than 
its shareholders can earn for themselves.
But managers are human beings; they cannot be 
perfect servants who always and everywhere maximize 
value. We will consider the conflicts of interest that 
arise in large corporations and how corporate governance helps to align the interests of managers and 
shareholders.
If we ask managers to maximize value, can the corporation also be a good citizen? Won’t the managers be 
tempted to try unethical or illegal financial tricks? They 
may sometimes be tempted, but wise managers realize 
that such tricks are not just dishonest; they almost 
always destroy value, not increase it. More challenging 
are the gray areas where the line between ethical and 
unethical financial actions is hard to draw.
Finally, we look ahead to the rest of this book and look 
back to some entertaining snippets of financial history.

1.1 Investment and Financing Decisions
Fred Smith is best known today as the founder of FedEx. But in 1965 he was still a 
sophomore at Yale, where he wrote an economics term paper arguing that delivery 
systems were not keeping up with increasing needs for speed and dependability.1
He later joined his stepfather at a struggling equipment and maintenance firm for air 
carriers. He observed firsthand the difficulties of shipping spare parts on short notice. 
He saw the need for an integrated air and ground delivery system with a central hub 
that could connect a large number of points more efficiently than a point-to-point 
delivery system. In 1971, at the age of 27, Smith founded Federal Express.
Like many start-up firms, Federal Express flirted again and again with failure. 
Smith and his family had an inheritance of a few million dollars, but this was far from 
enough. The young company needed to purchase and retrofit a small fleet of aging 
Dassault Falcon jets; build a central-hub facility; and hire and train pilots, delivery, 
and office staff. The initial source of capital was short-term bank loans. Because of the 
company’s shaky financial position, the bank demanded that the planes be used as 
collateral and that Smith personally guarantee the loan with his own money.
In April 1973, the company went live with a fleet of 14 jets, servicing 25 U.S. cities 
out of its Memphis hub. By then, the company had spent $25 million and was effectively flat broke, without enough funds to pay for its weekly delivery of jet fuel. 
In desperation, it managed to acquire a bank loan for $23.7 million. This loan had to be 
backed by a guarantee from General Dynamics, which in return acquired an option to 
buy the company. (Today, General Dynamics must regret that it never exercised 
this option.)
In November of that year, the company finally achieved some financial stability 
when it raised $24.5 million from venture capitalists, investment firms that provide 
funds and advice to young companies in return for a partial ownership share. Eventually, venture capitalists invested about $90 million in Federal Express.
In 1977, private firms were allowed for the first time to compete with the Postal 
Service in package delivery. Federal Express responded by expanding its operations. 
It acquired seven Boeing 727s, each with about seven times the capacity of the Falcon 
jets. To pay for these new investments, Federal Express raised about $19 million by 
selling shares of stock to the general public in an initial public offering (IPO). The new 
stockholders became part-owners of the company in proportion to the number of 
shares they purchased.
From this point on, success followed success, and the company invested heavily to 
expand its air fleet as well as its supporting infrastructure. It introduced an automated 
shipping system and a bar-coded tracking system. In 1994, it launched its fedex.com
website for online package tracking. It opened several new hubs across the United 
States as well as in Canada, France, the Philippines, and China. In 2007, FedEx (as the 
company was now called) became the world’s largest airline measured by number of 
planes. FedEx also invested in other companies, capped by the acquisition of Kinko’s 
for $2.4 billion in 2004. By 2016, FedEx had 325,000 employees, annual revenue of 
$49 billion, and a stock market value of almost $40 billion. Its name had become a 
verb—to “FedEx a package” was to ship it overnight.
Even in retrospect, FedEx’s success was hardly a sure thing. Fred Smith’s idea was 
inspired, but its implementation was complex and difficult. FedEx had to make good 
investment decisions. In the beginning, these decisions were constrained by lack of 
financing. For example, used Falcon jets were the only option, given the young company’s precarious financial position. At first it could service only a short list of the 
major cities. As the company grew, its investment decisions became more complex. 
Which type of planes should it buy? When should it expand coverage to Europe and 
1
 Legend has it that Smith received a grade of C on this paper. In fact, he doesn’t remember the grade.

Asia? How many operations hubs should it build? What computer and tracking systems were necessary to keep up with the increasing package volume and geographic 
coverage? Which companies should it acquire as it expanded its range of services?
FedEx also needed to make good financing decisions. For example, how should it 
raise the money it needed for investment? In the beginning, these choices were limited 
to family money and bank loans. As the company grew, its range of choices expanded. 
Eventually it was able to attract funding from venture capitalists, but this posed new 
questions. How much cash did the firm need to raise from the venture capitalists? How 
big a share in the firm would the venture capitalists demand in return? The initial public 
offering of stock prompted similar questions. How many shares should the company try 
to sell? At what price? As the company grew, it raised more funds by borrowing money 
from its banks and by selling publicly traded bonds to investors. At each point, it needed 
to decide on the proper form and terms of financing as well as the amounts to be raised.
In short, FedEx needed to be good at finance. It had a head start over potential 
competitors, but a series of bad financial decisions would have sunk the company. 
No two companies’ histories are the same, but, like FedEx, all successful companies 
must make good investment and financing decisions. And, as with FedEx, those 
decisions range from prosaic and obvious to difficult and strategically crucial.
Let’s widen our discussion. Table 1.1 gives an example of a recent investment and 
financing decision for 11 corporations. Seven are U.S. corporations. Four are foreign: 
Virgin Atlantic’s headquarters are in London, TransCanada’s in Calgary, LVMH’s in 
Paris,2
 and Vale’s in Rio de Janeiro. We have chosen very large public corporations 
that you are likely to be familiar with. You may have flown with Virgin Atlantic, 
shopped at Walmart, or posted a picture on Facebook.

6 Part One Introduction
bre22619_ch01_002-031.indd 6 10/06/16 03:32 PM
Take a look at the decisions now. We think you will agree that they appear 
sensible—at least there is nothing obviously wrong with them. But if you are new to 
finance, it may be difficult to think about why these companies made these decisions 
and not others.
The Investment (Capital Budgeting) Decision
Investment decisions, such as those shown in Table 1.1, are also called capital 
budgeting or capital expenditure (CAPEX) decisions. Some of the investments in 
the table, such as Walmart’s new stores or Virgin Atlantic’s new planes, involve 
tangible assets—assets that you can touch and kick. Others involve intangible assets, 
such as research and development (R&D), advertising, and the design of computer 
software. For example, major pharmaceutical manufacturers invest billions every year 
on R&D for new drugs.
Most of the investments in Table 1.1 have long-term consequences. For example, 
the planes acquired by Virgin Atlantic may still be flying 20 or 30 years from now. 
Other investments may pay off in only a few months. For example, with the approach 
of the Christmas holidays, Walmart spends nearly $50 billion to stock up its warehouses and retail stores. As the goods are sold over the following months, the company 
recovers its investment in these inventories.
The world of business can be intensely competitive, and corporations prosper only 
if they can keep launching new products or services. In some cases, the costs and risks 
of doing so are amazingly large. For example, the cost of developing the Gorgon 
natural gas field in Australia has been estimated at $54 billion. It’s not surprising that 
this cost is being shared among several major energy companies. But do not think of 
companies as making billion-dollar investments on a daily basis. Most investment 
decisions are smaller, such as the purchase of a truck, machine tool, or computer 
system. Corporations make thousands of such investments each year. The cumulative 
amount of these small expenditures can be just as large as the occasional jumbo investments, such as those shown in Table 1.1.
Not all investments succeed. In October 2011 Hewlett-Packard (HP) paid $11.1 
billion to acquire the British software company Autonomy. Just 13 months later, 
HP wrote down the value of this investment by $8.8 billion. HP claimed that it was 
misled by improper accounting at Autonomy. Nevertheless, the Autonomy acquisition 
was a disastrous investment for HP. HP’s CEO was fired in short order.
There are no free guarantees in finance. But you can tilt the odds in your favor if 
you learn the tools of investment analysis and apply them intelligently. We cover these 
tools in detail later in this book.
The Financing Decision
The financial manager’s second main responsibility is to raise the money that the firm 
requires for its investments and operations. This is the financing decision. When a 
company needs to raise money, it can invite investors to put up cash in exchange for a 
share of future profits, or it can promise to pay back the investors’ cash plus a fixed 
rate of interest. In the first case, the investors receive shares of stock and become 
shareholders, part-owners of the corporation. The investors in this case are referred to 
as equity investors, who contribute equity financing. In the second case, the investors 
are lenders, that is, debt investors, who one day must be repaid. The choice between 
debt and equity financing is often called the capital structure decision. Here “capital” 
refers to the firm’s sources of long-term financing. A firm that is seeking to raise longterm financing is said to be “raising capital.”
Notice the essential difference between the investment and financing decisions. 
When the firm invests, it acquires real assets, which are then used to produce the 
firm’s goods and services. The firm finances its investment in real assets by issuing 
financial assets to investors. A share of stock is a financial asset, which has value as a

tangible or intangible 
assets.

and amounts of financing.

claim on the firm’s real assets and on the income that those assets will produce. 
A bank loan is a financial asset also. It gives the bank the right to get its money back plus 
interest. If the firm’s operations can’t generate enough income to repay the bank, the 
bank can force the firm into bankruptcy and stake a claim on its real assets. Financial 
assets that can be purchased and traded by investors in public markets are called securities. The shares of stock issued by the public corporations in Table 1.1 are all securities. 
Entergy’s 10-year bond in Table 1.1 is a security. But a bank loan from JPMorgan to 
Entergy is not called a security unless the bank resells the loan to public investors.
The firm can issue an almost endless variety of financial assets. Suppose it decides 
to borrow. It can issue debt to investors, or it can borrow from a bank. It can borrow for 
1 year or 20 years. If it borrows for 20 years, it can reserve the right to pay off the debt 
early if interest rates fall. It can borrow in Paris, receiving and promising to repay 
euros, or it can borrow dollars in New York. (As Table 1.1 shows, Ford chose to borrow U.S. dollars, but it could have borrowed euros or Japanese yen instead.)
In some ways, financing decisions are less important than investment decisions. 
Financial managers say that “value comes mainly from the investment side of the balance sheet.” Also, the most successful corporations sometimes have the simplest 
financing strategies. Take Microsoft as an example. It is one of the world’s most valuable corporations. In early 2016, Microsoft shares traded for $53 each. There were 7.91 
billion shares outstanding. Therefore Microsoft’s market value—its market capitalization or market cap—was 53 × 7.91 = $419 billion. Where did this market value come 
from? It came from Microsoft’s products, from its brand name and worldwide customer base, from its R&D, and from its ability to make profitable future investments. 
It did not come from sophisticated financing. Microsoft’s financing strategy is very 
simple: It finances almost all investment by retaining and reinvesting operating cash flow.
Financing decisions may not add much value compared to good investment decisions, but they can destroy value if they are stupid or ambushed by bad news. For 
example, when a consortium of investment companies bought the energy giant TXU in 
2007, the company took on an additional $40 billion in debt. This may not have been a 
stupid decision, but it did prove fatal. The consortium did not foresee the expansion of 
shale gas production and the resulting sharp fall in natural gas and electricity prices, 
and in April 2014 the company (renamed Energy Future Holdings) was bankrupt.
We have emphasized the financial manager’s responsibility for two decisions:
The investment decision = purchase of real assets
The financing decision = sale of financial assets
But this is an oversimplification because the financial manager is also involved in many 
other day-to-day activities that are essential to the smooth operation of a business. 
Are the following capital budgeting or financing decisions? (Hint: In one case the 
answer is “both.”)
a. Intel decides to spend $7 billion to develop a new microprocessor factory.
b. BMW borrows 350 million euros (€350 million) from Deutsche Bank.
c. Royal Dutch Shell constructs a pipeline to bring natural gas onshore from a 
production platform in Australia.
d. Avon spends €200 million to launch a new range of cosmetics in European 
markets.
e. Pfizer issues new shares to buy a small biotech company.

For example, if the firm sells goods or services on credit, it needs to make sure that its 
customers pay on time. Corporations that operate internationally must constantly transfer cash from one currency to another. And the manager must keep an eye on the risks 
that the firm runs and ensure that they don’t land the firm in a pickle.

 In the United States, corporations are identified by the label “Corporation,” “Incorporated,” or “Inc.,” as in 
Caterpillar Inc. The United Kingdom identifies public corporations by “plc” (short for “Public Limited 
Corporation”). French corporations have the suffix “SA” (“Société Anonyme”). The corresponding labels in 
Germany are “GmbH” (“Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung”) and “AG” (“Aktiengesellschaft”).
4
 “Shareholder” and “stockholder” mean exactly the same thing and are used interchangeably.
1.2 What Is a Corporation?
We have been referring to “corporations.” But before going too far or too fast, we need 
to offer some basic definitions.
A corporation is a distinct, permanent legal entity. Suppose you decide to create a 
new corporation.3
 You would work with a lawyer to prepare articles of incorporation,
which set out the purpose of the business and how it is to be financed, managed, and 
governed. These articles must conform to the laws of the state in which the business is 
incorporated. For many purposes, the corporation is considered a resident of its state. 
For example, it can enter into contracts, borrow or lend money, and sue or be sued. 
It pays its own taxes (but it cannot vote!).
A corporation’s owners are called shareholders or stockholders.4
 The shareholders 
do not directly own the business’s real assets (factories, oil wells, stores, etc.). Instead 
they have indirect ownership via financial assets (the shares of the corporation).
A corporation is legally distinct from the shareholders. Therefore, the shareholders 
have limited liability and cannot be held personally responsible for the corporation’s 
debts. When the U.S. financial corporation Lehman Brothers failed in 2008, no one 
demanded that its stockholders put up more money to cover Lehman’s massive debts. 
Shareholders can lose their entire investment in a corporation, but no more.
corporation
A business organized as a 
separate legal entity 
owned by stockholders.
limited liability
The owners of a 
corporation are not 
personally liable for its 
obligations.
Business Organization
Suppose you buy a building and open a restaurant. You have invested in the building itself, 
kitchen equipment, dining-room furnishings, plus various other assets. If you do not incorporate, you own these assets personally, as the sole proprietor of the business. If you have 
borrowed money from a bank to start the business, then you are personally responsible for 
this debt. If the business loses money and cannot pay the bank, then the bank can demand 
Example 1.1 ⊲
Which of the following are financial assets, and which are real assets?
a. A patent.
b. A share of stock issued by Wells Fargo Bank.
c. A blast furnace in a steelmaking factory.
d. A mortgage loan taken out to help pay for a new home.
e. After a successful advertising campaign, potential customers trust FedEx to 
deliver packages promptly and reliably.
f. An IOU (“I owe you”) from your brother-in-law.

When a corporation is first established, its shares may be privately owned by a 
small group of investors, perhaps the company’s managers and a few backers. In this 
case, the shares are not publicly traded and the company is closely held. Eventually, 
when the f
