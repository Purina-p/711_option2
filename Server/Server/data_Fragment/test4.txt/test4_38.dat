million by issuing long-term debt. 
But it paid out $2,530 million to stockholders in the form of dividends and used 
another $7,000 million to repurchase stock.7
To summarize, the cash-flow statement tells us that Home Depot generated $8,127 
million from operations, spent $1,258 million on new investments, and used $7,075 
million in financing activities. Home Depot earned and raised less cash than it spent.

 You might think that interest payments also ought to be listed in this section. However, it is usual to include 
interest in the first section with cash flow from operations. This is because, unlike dividends, interest payments 
are not discretionary. The firm must pay interest when a payment comes due, so these payments are treated as a 
business expense rather than as a financing decision.

Therefore, its cash balance decreased by $206 million. To calculate this change in 
cash balance, we subtract the uses of cash from the sources:
In Millions
 Cash flow from operations $8,127
− Cash flow for new investment −1,258
+ Cash provided by new financing −7,075
= Change in cash balance −$ 206
Look back at Table 3.1 and you will see that cash accounts on the balance sheet did 
indeed decrease by $206 million in 2014.8

 Home Depot’s published statement of cash flows differs from the cash-flow statement that we derived from 
the balance sheet and income statement. This is a common occurrence, particularly if the company has engaged 
in mergers or divestitures during the year.
Free Cash Flow
The value of a company depends on how much cash it can generate for investors after 
it has paid for any new capital investments. This cash is called the company’s 
free cash flow. Free cash flow is available to be paid out to investors as interest or 
dividends or to repay debt or buy back stock.
free cash flow
Cash available for 
distribution to investors 
after firm pays for new 
investments or additions to 
working capital.
Free Cash Flow for Home Depot
Let’s use Home Depot’s income and cash-flow statements to calculate its free cash flow in 
2014. We start with the earnings produced by the firm’s ongoing operations. This is equal to 
Net income + debt interest = $6,345 + $830 = $7,175 million
We need to make two adjustments to this figure for those parts of the income statement 
that do not involve cash coming in or going out. First, we must add back depreciation 
because depreciation is not a cash outflow, even though it is treated as an expense in the 
income statement. Second, accounting income is not cash in the bank. For example, the firm 
may need to lay out money to buy materials ahead of time, or its customers may not pay for 
their purchases immediately. Therefore, to measure the cash from ongoing operations, we 
need to subtract those additions to net working capital shown in the top panel of the statement of cash flows. This gives us cash flow from operations:
Cash flow from operations = (net income + interest) + depreciation − additions to
net working capital 
 = $7,175 + $1,786 − $4 = $8,957 million
Example 3.3 ⊲
Would the following activities increase or decrease the firm’s cash balance?
a. Inventories are increased.
b. The firm reduces its accounts payable.
c. The firm issues additional common stock.
d. The firm buys new equipment.

Accounting Practice and Malpractice
Managers of public companies face constant scrutiny. Much of that scrutiny focuses 
on earnings. Security analysts forecast earnings per share, and investors then wait to 
see whether the company can meet or beat the forecasts. A shortfall, even if it is only a 
cent or two, can be a big disappointment. Investors might judge that if you could not 
find that extra cent or two of earnings, the firm must be in a really bad way.
Managers complain about this pressure, but do they do anything about it? Unfortunately, the answer appears to be yes, according to Graham, Harvey, and Rajgopal, who 
surveyed about 400 senior managers.11 Most of the managers said that accounting 
earnings were the single most important number reported to investors. Most admitted 
to adjusting their firms’ operations and investments to produce the earnings that investors were looking for. For example, 80% were prepared to decrease discretionary 
spending on R&D, advertising, or plant maintenance to meet earnings targets.
Of course, managers may not need to adjust the firm’s operations if they can instead 
adjust their accounting methods. U.S. accounting rules are spelled out by the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and its generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP). Yet, inevitably, rules and principles leave room for discretion, and managers 
under pressure to perform are tempted to take advantage of this leeway to satisfy 
3.4
This cash is not all available to be paid out to investors, for the company needs some of 
the cash for new capital expenditures. So the capital that is free for distribution is
Free cash flow = cash flow from operations − capital expenditures
= $8,957 − $1,258 = $7,699 million
Notice that free cash flow differs from the addition-to-cash balances found in the statement of cash flows (Table 3.4). First, when we calculate free cash flow, we ignore altogether 
items in the last panel of Table 3.4, “Cash provided by financing activities.”9 This is because 
free cash flow measures how much cash the company’s operations generate for possible 
distribution to investors. The available amount should not be confused with the amount that 
the company actually raised by financing activities. Second, we add back interest payments 
when computing free cash flow, as those payments are part of the distributions made to 
investors.10
It is often useful to ask what Home Depot’s free cash flow would have been if the 
company had been financed entirely by equity. In that case, all the free cash flow would 
belong to the shareholders. However, if Home Depot no longer paid out $830 million as 
interest, pretax income would be increased by that amount, and the company would pay an 
additional .35 × 830 = $290.50 million in tax. Thus, if the company was financed solely 
by equity, free cash flow would have been $7,699 − $290.50 = $7,408.50 million. ■
9
 For this reason, when we calculated cash flow from operations, we ignored the change in holdings of shortterm debt, even though this short-term debt is listed under current liabilities. We were interested only in the 
items of working capital that arose from the firm’s operations.
10 We can check the logic linking free cash flow to the statement of cash flows as follows:

Journal of Accounting and Economics 40 (2005), pp. 3–73.

investors. Investors worry about the fact that some companies seem particularly prone 
to inflate their earnings by playing fast and loose with accounting practice. They refer 
to such companies as having “low-quality” earnings, and they place a correspondingly 
lower value on the firms’ stock.
Here are some examples of ambiguities in accounting rules that have been used by 
companies to conceal unflattering information:
∙ Revenue recognition. As we saw earlier, firms record a sale when it is made, not 
when the customer actually pays. But the date of sale is not always obvious. 
Suppose it is November and you are concerned that if your firm does not meet its 
sales target, you can forget about your annual bonus. You contact your main 
customers, and they agree to increase their December orders as long as they have 
the right to return any unsold goods. Your firm then books these shipments as 
“sales,” even though there is a high likelihood that many of the goods will be 
returned. That is almost certainly illegal and will get you into serious trouble. 
But suppose instead that you tell your customers that the price of your product 
may rise in the new year and suggest that they place an extra order in December. 
This practice, known as “channel stuffing,” increases this year’s sales at the 
expense of next year’s sales.
 Many companies have been thought to use channel stuffing to overstate their 
earnings, but very blatant instances are liable to attract the SEC’s attention. 
For example, in 2002 the pharmaceutical giant, Bristol Myers Squibb, disclosed 
that wholesalers were holding hundreds of millions of dollars in excessive 
inventories of its products and the company’s earnings for 2002 might be just half 
of its 2001 earnings as wholesalers worked down these inventories. Following an 
investigation by the SEC, the company agreed to pay $150 million to settle 
accusations that this channel stuffing had improperly inflated its sales and earnings. 
In Chapter 1, we mentioned Hewlett-Packard’s disastrous acquisition of the British 
company Autonomy. Hewlett-Packard paid $11.1 billion for Autonomy. Just over a 
year later, it wrote down the value of the company by $8.8 billion, alleging that 
Autonomy had used channel stuffing to greatly inflate its revenues.
∙ Cookie-jar reserves. The giant mortgage-pass-through firm Freddie Mac earned the 
Wall Street nickname “Steady Freddie” for its unusually smooth and predictable 
pattern of earnings growth, at least until 2008 when it suddenly collapsed in the 
wake of the meltdown in subprime mortgages. Unfortunately, it emerged in 2003 
that Freddie achieved this predictability in part by misusing its reserve accounts. 
Normally, such accounts are intended to allow for the likely impact of events 
that might reduce earnings, such as the failure of customers to pay their bills. 
But Freddie seemed to “overreserve” against such contingencies so that it could 
“release” those reserves and bolster income in a bad year. Its steady growth was 
largely a matter of earnings management.
∙ Off–balance sheet assets and liabilities. Before its bankruptcy in 2001 (at that time, 
the second largest in U.S. history), Enron had accumulated large debts and had also 
guaranteed the debts of other companies in which it had an ownership stake. 
To present a fair view of the firm, Enron should have recognized these potential 
liabilities on its balance sheet. But the firm created and placed paper firms—
so-called special-purpose entities (SPEs)—in the middle of its transactions and 
excluded these liabilities from its financial statements.
The collapse of Enron illustrates how dishonest managers with creamy compensation packages may be tempted to conceal the truth from investors. If the company had 
been more transparent to outsiders—that is, if they could have assessed its true profitability and prospects—its problems would have shown up right away in a falling stock 
price. This in turn would have generated extra scrutiny from security analysts, bond 
rating agencies, lenders, and investors.

With transparency, corporate troubles generally lead to corrective action. But the 
top management of a troubled and opaque company may be able to maintain its stock 
price and postpone the discipline of the market. Market discipline caught up with 
Enron only a month or two before bankruptcy.
Enron was not the only company to be mired in accounting scandals in the early 
years of the century. Firms such as Global Crossing, Qwest Communications, and 
WorldCom misstated profits by billions of dollars. Overseas, the Italian dairy company Parmalat falsified the existence of a bank account to the tune of $5.5 billion, and 
the French media and entertainment company Vivendi came close to bankruptcy after 
it was accused of accounting fraud. In response to these scandals, Congress passed the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, widely known as SOX. A major goal of SOX is to increase transparency and ensure that companies and their accountants provide directors, lenders, 
and shareholders with the information they need to monitor progress.
SOX created the Public Accounting Oversight Board to oversee the auditing of 
public companies; it banned accounting firms from offering other services to companies whose accounts they audit; it prohibited any individual from heading a firm’s 
audit for more than 5 years; and it required that the board’s audit committee consist of 
directors who are independent of the company’s management. Sarbanes-Oxley also 
required that management certify that the financial statements present a fair view of 
the firm’s financial position and demonstrate that the firm has adequate controls and 
procedures for financial reporting. All this has come at a price. Managers and investors worry that the costs of SOX and the bur
