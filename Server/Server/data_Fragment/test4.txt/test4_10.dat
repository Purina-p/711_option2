he or she sold it for. As the saying goes, “He who sells what isn’t his’n, buys it 
back or goes to prison.”
†The story of Paulson’s trade is told in G. Zuckerman, The Greatest Trade Ever 
(Broadway Business, 2009). The trade was controversial for reasons beyond 
short-selling. Scan the nearby Beyond the Page icon “Goldman Sachs causes a 
ruckus” to learn more.
Short-Selling
Investors who take short positions are betting that securities 
will fall in price. Usually they do this by borrowing the security, 
selling it for cash, and then waiting in the hope that they will 
be able to buy it back cheaply.* In 2007, hedge fund manager 
John Paulson took a huge short position in mortgage-backed 
securities. The bet paid off, and that year Paulson’s trade 
made a profit of $1 billion for his fund.†
Was Paulson’s trade unethical? Some believe not only that 
he was profiting from the misery that resulted from the crash 
in mortgage-backed securities, but that his short trades 
accentuated the collapse. It is certainly true that short-sellers 
have never been popular. For example, following the crash of 
1929, one commentator compared short-selling to the ghoulishness of “creatures who, at all great earthquakes and fires, 
spring up to rob broken homes and injured and dead 
humans.”
Short-selling in the stock market is the Wall Street Walk on 
steroids. Not only do short-sellers sell all the shares they may 
have previously owned, but they borrow more shares and sell 
them too, hoping to buy them back for less when the stock 
price falls. Poorly performing companies are natural targets 
for short-sellers, and the companies’ incumbent managers 
naturally complain, often bitterly. Governments sometimes 
listen to such complaints. For example, in 2008 the U.S. 
government temporarily banned short sales of financial 
stocks in an attempt to halt their decline.
But defendants of short-selling argue that selling securities that one believes are overpriced is no less legitimate 
than buying those that appear underpriced. The object of a 
well-functioning market is to set the correct stock prices, not 
always higher prices. Why impede short-selling if it conveys 
truly bad news, puts pressure on poor performers, and helps 
corporate governance work?
Corporate Raiders
In the movie Pretty Woman, Richard Gere plays the role of an 
asset stripper, Edward Lewis. He buys companies, takes them 
apart, and sells the bits for more than he paid for the total 
package. In the movie Wall Street, Gordon Gekko buys a 
failing airline, Blue Star, in order to break it up and sell the 
bits. Real corporate raiders may not be as ruthless as Edward 
Lewis or Gordon Gekko, but they do target companies whose 
assets can be profitably split up and redeployed.
This has led some to complain that raiders seek to carve 
up established companies, often leaving them with heavy 
debt burdens, basically in order to get rich quick. One 
German politician has likened them to “swarms of locusts that 
fall on companies, devour all they can, and then move on.”

It is not always easy to know what is ethical behavior, and there can be many gray 
areas. The nearby box presents three ethical controversies in finance. Think about 
where you stand on these issues and where you would draw the ethical line.

14 The careers are fictitious but based on the actual experiences of several of the authors’ students.
1.7 Careers in Finance
Well over 1 million people work in the financial services industry in the United States, 
and many others work as financial managers in corporations. We can’t tell you what 
each one does all day, but we can give you some idea of the variety of careers in finance. 
The nearby box summarizes the experience of a small sample of recent graduates.14
We explained earlier that corporations face two principal financial decisions: the 
investment decision and the financing decision. Therefore, as a newly recruited financial analyst, you may help to analyze a major new investment project. Or you may 
instead help to raise the money to pay for it, perhaps by negotiating a bank loan or by 
arranging to lease the plant and equipment. Other financial analysts work on shortterm finance, managing collection and investment of the company’s cash or checking 
whether customers are likely to pay their bills. Financial analysts are also involved in 
monitoring and controlling risk. For example, they may help to arrange insurance for 
the firm’s plant and equipment, or they may assist with the purchase and sale of 
options, futures, and other exotic tools for managing risk.
Instead of working in the finance department of a corporation, you may join a 
financial institution. The largest employers are banks. Banks collect deposits and 
relend the cash to corporations and individuals. If you join a bank, you may start in a 
branch office, where individuals and small businesses come to deposit cash or to seek 
a loan. You could also work in the head office, helping to analyze a $500 million loan 
to a large corporation.
Banks do many things in addition to lending money, and they probably provide a 
greater variety of jobs than other financial institutions. For example, if you work in the 
cash management department of a large bank, you may help companies to transfer 
huge sums of money electronically as wages, taxes, and payments to suppliers. Banks 
also buy and sell foreign exchange, so you could find yourself working in front of one 
of those computer screens in a foreign exchange trading room. Another glamorous 
bank job is in the derivatives group, which helps companies to manage their risk by 
buying and selling options, futures, and so on. This is where the mathematicians and 
the computer buffs thrive.
Investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, help companies sell 
their securities to investors. They also have large corporate finance departments that 
assist firms in mergers and acquisitions. When firms issue securities or try to take over 
another firm, a lot of money is at stake and the firms may need to move fast. Thus, 
working for an investment bank can be a high-pressure activity with long hours. It can 
also pay very well.
The insurance industry is another large employer. Much of the insurance industry is 
involved in designing and selling insurance policies on people’s lives and property, but 
businesses are also major customers. So, if you work for an insurance company or a 
large insurance broker, you could find yourself arranging insurance on a Boeing 787 in 
the United States or an oil rig in Indonesia.
Life insurance companies are major lenders to corporations and to investors in commercial real estate. (Life insurance companies deploy the insurance premiums received 
from policyholders into medium- or long-term loans; banks specialize in shorter-term 
financing.) So you could end up negotiating a $50 million loan for construction of a 
new shopping center or investigating the creditworthiness of a family-owned manufacturing company that has applied for a loan to expand production.
Then there is the business of “managing money,” that is, deciding which companies’ shares to invest in or how to balance investment in shares with safer securities, 
such as the bonds (debt securities) issued by the U.S. Treasury. Take mutual funds, for 
example. A mutual fund collects money from individuals and invests in a portfolio of

Albert Rodriguez, European Markets Group, 
Major New York Bank
I joined the bank after majoring in finance. I spent the first 
6 months in the bank’s training program, rotating among 
departments. I was assigned to the European markets 
team just before the 2010 Greek crisis, when worries about 
a possible default caused interest rates on Greek government debt to jump to more than 4% above the rate on 
comparable German government debt. Those rates soon 
went much higher! There was a lot of activity, with everyone trying to figure out whether Greece might be forced 
to abandon the euro and how this would affect our business. My job is largely concerned with analyzing economies and assessing the prospects for bank business. 
There are plenty of opportunities to work abroad, and 
I hope to spend some time in Madrid or one of our other 
European offices.
Sherry Solera, Branch Manager, Regional Bank
I took basic finance courses in college, but nothing specific for banking. I started here as a teller. I was able to 
learn about banking through the bank’s training program 
and also by evening courses at a local college. Last year I 
was promoted to branch manager. I oversee the branch’s 
operations and help customers with a wide variety of problems. I’m also spending more time on credit analysis of 
business loan applications. I want to expand the branch’s 
business customers, but not by making loans to shaky 
companies.
Susan Webb, Research Analyst, Mutual Fund Group
After majoring in biochemistry, I joined the research department of a large mutual fund group. Because of my background, I was assigned to work with the senior pharmaceuticals 
analyst. I start the day by reading The Wall Street Journal and 
reviewing the analyses that come in each day from stockbroking firms. Sometimes we need to revise our earnings 
forecasts and meet with the portfolio managers to discuss 
possible trades. The remainder of my day is spent mainly in 
analyzing companies and developing forecasts of revenues 
and earnings. I meet frequently with pharmaceutical analysts 
in stockbroking firms, and we regularly visit company management. In the evenings I study for the Chartered Financial 
Analyst (CFA) exam. I did not study finance at college, so this 
is quite challenging. I hope eventually to move from a 
research role to become a portfolio manager.
Richard Gradley, Project Finance, Large Energy Company
After leaving college, I joined the finance department of a 
large energy company. I spent my first year helping to analyze capital investment proposals. I then moved to the project 
finance group, which is responsible for analyzing independent power projects around the world. Recently, I have been 
involved in a proposal to set up a company that would build 
and operate a large new electricity plant in southeast Asia. 
We built a spreadsheet model of the project to make sure that 
it was viable. We had to check that the contracts with the 
builders, operators, suppliers, and so on, were all in place 
before we could arrange bank financing for the project.

stocks or bonds. A financial analyst in a mutual fund analyzes the prospects for the 
securities and works with the investment manager to decide which should be bought 
and sold. Many other financial institutions also contain investment management 
departments. For example, you might work as a financial analyst in the investment 
department of an insurance company. (Insurance companies also invest in traded 
securities.) Or you could be a financial analyst in the trust department of a bank that 
manages money for retirement funds, universities, and charities.
Stockbroking firms help investment management companies and private individuals to invest in securities. They employ sales staff and dealers who make the trades. 
They also employ financial analysts to analyze the securities and help customers to 
decide which to buy or sell.
Investment banks and stockbroking firms are largely headquartered in New York, as 
are many of the large commercial banks. Insurance companies and investment management companies tend to be more scattered. For example, some of the largest insurance 
companies are headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut, and many investment management companies are located in Boston. Of course, some U.S. financial institutions have 
large businesses outside the United States. Finance is a global business. So you may 
spend some time working in a branch overseas or making the occasional trip to one of 
the other major financial centers, such as London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, or Singapore.
