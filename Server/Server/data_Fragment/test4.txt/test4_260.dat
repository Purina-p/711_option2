to monitor its progress. For this reason, the company

Until the mid-nineteenth century, most businesses 
were owner-managed and seldom required outside 
capital beyond personal loans to the proprietor. There 
was little need, therefore, for firms to produce comprehensive accounting information. But with the industrial 
revolution and the creation of large railroad and canal 
companies, the shareholders and bankers demanded 
information that would help them gauge a firmâ€™s financial strength. That was when the accounting profession 
began to come of age.
We donâ€™t want to get lost in the details of accounting 
practice. But because we will refer to financial statements throughout this book, it may be useful to review 
briefly their main features. In this chapter, we introduce 
the major financial statements: the balance sheet, the 
income statement, and the statement of cash flows.
