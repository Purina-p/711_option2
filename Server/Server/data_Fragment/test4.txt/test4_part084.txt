 at the right times. “Corporate governance” refers to the laws, regulations, 
institutions, and corporate practices that protect shareholders and other investors. 
When scandals happen, we say that corporate governance has broken down. When 
corporations compete to deliver value to shareholders, we are comforted that corporate 
governance is working properly.
Good corporate governance relies in part on well-designed management compensation packages. Other elements of good corporate governance include the following.
Legal Requirements Good governance requires laws and regulations that protect 
investors from self-dealing by insiders. CEOs and financial managers have a fiduciary 
duty to stockholders. That is, they are required to act fairly and responsibly in the 
stockholders’ interests. If they don’t, they may end up in jail like Tyco’s Dennis 
Kozlowski and Hollinger’s Conrad Black.
Boards of Directors The board of directors appoints top managers, including the 
CEO and CFO, and must approve important financial decisions.
