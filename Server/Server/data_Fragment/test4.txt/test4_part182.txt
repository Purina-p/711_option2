Like mutual funds, hedge funds also pool the savings of different investors and 
invest on their behalf. But they differ from mutual funds in at least two ways. First, 
because hedge funds usually follow complex, high-risk investment strategies, access is 
usually restricted to knowledgeable investors such as pension funds, endowment funds, 
and wealthy individuals. Don’t try to send a check for $3,000 or $5,000 to a hedge 
fund; most hedge funds are not in the “retail” investment business. Second, hedge 
funds try to attract the most talented managers by compensating them with potentially 
lucrative, performance-related fees.4
 In contrast, mutual funds usually charge a fixed 
percentage of assets under management.
Hedge funds follow many different investment strategies.
