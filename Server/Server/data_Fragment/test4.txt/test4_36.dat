l expenditures (such as the 
purchase of new machinery). Current expenditures are deducted from current 
profits. However, rather than deducting the cost of long-lived machinery in the year 
it is purchased, the accountant spreads its acquisition cost over its forecasted life by 
making an annual charge for depreciation.
Thus, when calculating profits, the accountant does not deduct the expenditure 
on new equipment that year, even though cash is paid out. However, the accountant 
does deduct depreciation on assets previously purchased, even though no cash is 
currently paid out. For example, suppose a $100,000 investment is depreciated by 
$10,000 a year for 10 years.6
 This depreciation is treated as an annual expense, 
although the cash actually went out of the door when the asset was first purchased. 
For this reason, the deduction for depreciation is classified as a noncash expense.
To calculate the cash produced by the business, it is necessary to add the 
depreciation charge (which is not a cash payment) back to accounting profits 
and to subtract the expenditure on new capital equipment (which is a cash 
payment).
2. Cash versus accrual accounting. Consider a manufacturer that spends $60 to 
produce goods in period 1. In period 2 it sells these goods for $100, but its customers 
pay their bills with a delay, so payment is not received until period 3. The following 
diagram shows the firm’s cash flows. In period 1 there is a cash outflow of $60. 
Then, when customers pay their bills in period 3, there is an inflow of $100.
+$100 (collect payment)
-$60 (pay for goods)
1 2 3 Period

 We discuss depreciation rules in Chapter 9.
It would be misleading to say that the firm was running at a loss in period 1 
(when cash flow was negative) or that it was extremely profitable in period 3 (when 
cash flow was positive). Therefore, to construct the income statement, the 
accountant looks at when the sale was made (period 2 in our example) and gathers 
together all the revenues and expenses associated with that sale. For our company, 
the income statement would show:
Revenue $100
Less cost of goods sold 60
Profit $ 40
This practice of matching revenues and expenses is known as accrual accounting.
Of course, the accountant does not ignore the actual timing of the cash expenditures 
and payments. So the cash outlay in the first period will be treated not as an expense 
but as an investment in inventories. Subsequently, in period 2, when the goods are 
taken out of inventory and sold, the accountant shows a reduction in inventories.
To go from the cost of goods sold in the income statement to the cash outflows, 
we need to subtract the investment in inventories that is shown in the balance sheet:
Period: 1 2
 Cost of goods sold (income statement) 0 60
+ Investment in inventories (balance sheet) 60 −60
= Cash paid out 60 0

The accountant also does not ignore the fact that the firm has to wait until period 3 
to collect its bills. When the sale is made in period 2, the figure for accounts receivable 
in the balance sheet is increased to show that the company’s customers owe an extra 
$100 in unpaid bills. Later, when the customers pay those bills in period 3, accounts 
receivable are reduced by $100. Therefore, to go from the sales shown in the income 
statement to the cash inflows, we need to subtract the investment in receivables:
Period: 2 3
 Sales (income statement) 100 0
− Investment in receivables (balance sheet) 100 −100
= Cash received 0 +100
We will return to these issues in more detail in Chapter 9, but for now we summarize the key points as follows: Cash outflow is equal to the cost of goods sold, which is 
shown in the income statement, plus the change in inventories. Cash inflow is equal to 
the sales shown in the income statement less the change in uncollected bills.
Profits versus Cash Flows
Suppose our manufacturer spends a further $80 to produce goods in period 2. It sells these 
goods in period 3 for $120, but customers do not pay their bills until period 4.
The cash flows from these transactions are now as follows:
Example 3.2 ⊲
Period: 1 2 3
 Cost of goods sold (income statement) 0 60 80
+ Investment in inventories (balance sheet) 60 −60 + 80 = 20 −80
= Cash paid out 60 80 0
$100
(collect payment)
$120
(collect further payment)
-$60
(pay for goods) -$80
(pay for more goods)
1 2 3 4 Period
How do the new transactions affect the income statement and the balance sheet? 
The income statement will match costs with revenues and record the cost of goods sold 
when the sales are made in periods 1 and 2. The difference between the costs shown in the 
income statement and the cash flows is recorded as an investment (and later, disinvestment) 
in inventories. Thus, in period 1 the accountant shows an investment in inventories of 
$60 just as before. In period 2, these goods are taken out of inventory and sold, but the firm 
also produces a further $80 of goods. Thus, there is a net increase in inventories of $20. 
As these goods in turn are sold in period 3, inventories are reduced by $80. The following 
table confirms that the cash outflow in each period is equal to the cost of goods sold that is 
shown in the income statement plus the change in inventories.

The Statement of Cash Flows
The firm requires cash when it buys new plant and machinery or when it pays interest 
to the bank and dividends to the shareholders. Therefore, the financial manager needs 
to keep track of the cash that is coming in and going out.
We have seen that the firm’s cash flow can be quite different from its net income. 
These differences can arise for at least two reasons:
1. The income statement does not recognize capital expenditures as expenses in the 
year that the capital goods are paid for. Instead, it spreads those expenses over time 
in the form of an annual deduction for depreciation.
2. The income statement uses the accrual method of accounting, which means that 
revenues and expenses are recognized when sales are made, rather than when the 
cash is received or paid out.
The statement of cash flows shows the firm’s cash inflows and outflows from operations as well as from its investments and financing activities. Table 3.4 is the cash-flow 
statement for Home Depot. It contains three sections. The first shows the cash flow from 
operations. This is the cash generated from Home Depot’s normal business activities. 
Next comes the cash that Home Depot has invested in plant and equipment or in the 
acquisition of new businesses. The final section reports cash flows from financing activities such as the sale of new debt or stock. We will look at each of these sections in turn.
The first section, cash flow from operations, starts with net income but adjusts that 
figure for those parts of the income statement that do not involve cash coming in or 
going out. Therefore, it adds back the allowance for depreciation because depreciation 
is not a cash outflow, even though it is treated as an expense in the income statement.
Any additions to current assets (other than cash itself) need to be subtracted from 
net income because these absorb cash but do not show up in the income statement. 
Conversely, any additions to current liabilities need to be added to net income because 
these release cash. For example, you can see that the increase of $86 million in accounts

Period: 2 3 4
 Sales (income statement) 100 120 0
− Investment in receivables (balance sheet) 100 −100 + 120 = 20 −120
= Cash received 0 +100 +120
The following table provides a similar reconciliation of the difference between the revenues shown in the income statement and the cash inflow:
In the income statement the accountant records sales of $100 in period 1 and $120 in 
period 2. The fact that the firm has to wait for payment is recognized in the balance sheet as 
an investment in receivables. The cash that the company receives is equal to the sales 
shown in the income statement less the investment in receivables. ■
Consider a firm that spends $200 to produce goods in period 1. In
