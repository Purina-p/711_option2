they are discussed:
∙ Foreign exchange markets (Chapter 22). Any corporation engaged in international 
trade must be able to transfer money back and forth between dollars and other 
currencies. Foreign exchange is traded over the counter through a network of the 
largest international banks.
∙ Commodities markets (Chapter 24). Dozens of commodities are traded on organized 
exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) or the Intercontinental 
Exchange. You can buy or sell corn, wheat, cotton, fuel oil, natural gas, copper, 
silver, platinum, and so on.
∙ Markets for options and other derivatives (Chapters 23 and 24). Derivatives are 
securities whose payoffs depend on the prices of other securities or commodities. 
For example, you can buy an option to purchase IBM shares at a fixed price on a 
fixed future date. The option’s payoff depends on the price of IBM shares on that 
date. Commodities can be traded by a different kind of derivative security called a 
futures contract.

Trump contracts declined. But as it became clear that Trump

April, the price of Trump contracts dramatically recovered.
The red line in the figure is for “Rest of field” (i.e., a contract that will pay off $1 if anyone other than the named candidates in the figure wins the nomination). The 20 cent price for 
this contract in early April is evidence that even at this late 
date, there was meaningful uncertainty about the prospects 
for a contested convention in which someone other than the 
current
