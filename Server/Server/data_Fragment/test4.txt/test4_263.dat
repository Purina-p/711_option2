m’s balance sheet, the income statement, and 
a statement of cash flows. We will review each in turn.1
Firms need to raise cash to pay for the many assets used in their businesses. In the 
process of raising that cash, they also acquire obligations or “liabilities” to those who 
provide the funding. The balance sheet presents a snapshot of the firm’s assets and 
liabilities at one particular moment. The assets—representing the uses of the funds 
raised—are listed on the left-hand side of the balance sheet. The liabilities—
representing the sources of that funding—are listed on the right.
Some assets can be turned more easily into cash than others; these are known as 
liquid assets. The accountant puts the most liquid assets at the top of the list and works 
down to the least liquid. Look, for example, at Table 3.1, which shows the consolidated balance sheet for Home Depot (HD), at the end of its 2014 fiscal year.2
 (“Consolidated” simply means that the balance sheet shows the position of Home Depot and 
any companies it owns.) You can see that Home Depot had $1,723 million of cash and 
marketable securities. In addition, it had sold goods worth $1,484 million but had not 
yet received payment. These payments are due soon, and therefore the balance sheet 
shows the unpaid bills or accounts receivable (or simply receivables) as a current 
asset. The next asset consists of inventories. These may be (1) raw materials and ingredients that the firm bought from suppliers, (2) work in progress, and (3) finished products waiting to be shipped from the warehouse. For Home
