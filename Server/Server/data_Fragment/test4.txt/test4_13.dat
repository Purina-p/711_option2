rations grow, their requirements for outside capital can expand dramatically. At some point the firm will decide to “go public” by issuing shares on an organized exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ; that first 
issue is called an initial public offering or IPO. The buyers of the IPO are helping to 
finance the firm’s investment in real assets. In return, the buyers become part-owners 
of the firm and participate in its future success or failure. (Most investors in the Internet IPOs of 1999 and 2000 are by now sorely disappointed, but many IPOs pay off 
handsomely. If only we had bought Apple shares on their IPO day in 1980 . . .) Of 
course a corporation’s IPO is not its last chance to issue shares. For example, Bank of 
America went public in the 1930s, but it could make a new issue of shares tomorrow.
A new issue of shares increases both the amount of cash held by the company and 
the number of shares held by the public. Such an issue is known as a primary issue,
and it is sold in the primary market. But in addition to helping companies raise new 
cash, financial markets also allow investors to trade securities among themselves. For 
example, Smith might decide to raise some cash by selling her Apple stock at the same 
time that Jones invests his spare cash in Apple. The result is simply a transfer of ownership from Smith to Jones, which has no effect on the company itself. Such purchases 
and sales of existing securities are known as secondary transactions, and they take 
place in the secondary market. Notice that Smith and Jones might be less happy for 
Apple to raise new capital and invest in long-term projects if they could not sell their 
stock in the secondary market when they needed the cash for personal use.
Stock markets are also called equity markets because stockholders are said to own 
the common equity of the firm. You will hear financial managers refer to the capital 
structure decision as “the choice between debt and equity financing.”
Now may be a good time to stress that the financial manager plays on a global stage 
and needs to be familiar with markets around the world. For example, Apple’s stock is 
traded on the NASDAQ market and also in Germany on the Deutsche Börse. China 
Telecom, Deutsche Bank, Ferrari, Novartis, Petrobras (Brazil), Sony, Unilever, Manchester United football club, and more than 500 other overseas firms have listed their 
shares on the NYSE. We return to the trading and pricing of shares in Chapter 7.

Other Financial Markets
Debt securities as well as equities are traded in financial markets. The Apple bond 
issue in 1994 was sold publicly to investors (see Table 2.1). Table 1.1 in the previous 
chapter also gives examples of debt issues, including issues by Virgin Atlantic and 
Entergy Arkansas.
A few corporate debt securities are traded on the NYSE and other exchanges, but 
most corporate debt securities are traded over the counter, through a network of banks 
and securities dealers. Government debt is also traded over the counter.
A bond is a more complex security than a share of stock. A share is just a proportional ownership claim on the firm, with no definite maturity. Bonds and other debt 
securities can vary in maturity, in the degree of protection or collateral offered by the 
issuer, and in the level and timing of interest payments. Some bonds make “floating” 
interest payments tied to the future level of interest rates. Many can be “called” (repurchased and retired) by the issuing company before the bonds’ stated maturity date. 
Some bonds can be converted into other securities, usually the stock of the issuing 
company. You don’t need to master these distinctions now; just be aware that the debt 
or fixed-income market is a complicated and challenging place. A corporation must 
not only decide between debt and equity finance. It must also consider the design of 
debt. We return to the trading and pricing of debt securities in Chapter 6.
The markets for long-term debt and equity are called capital markets. A firm’s 
capital is its long-run financing. Short-term securities are traded in the money 
markets. “Short term” means less than 1 year. For example, large, creditworthy 
corporations raise short-term financing by issues of commercial paper, which are 
debt issues with maturities of no more than 270 days. Commercial paper is issued in 
the money market.
