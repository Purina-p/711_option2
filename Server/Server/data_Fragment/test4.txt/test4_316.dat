eady Freddie” for its unusually smooth and predictable 
pattern of earnings growth, at least until 2008 when it suddenly collapsed in the 
wake of the meltdown in subprime mortgages. Unfortunately, it emerged in 2003 
that Freddie achieved this predictability in part by misusing its reserve accounts. 
Normally, such accounts are intended to allow for the likely impact of events 
that might reduce earnings, such as the failure of customers to pay their bills. 
But Freddie seemed to “overreserve” against such contingencies so that it could 
“release” those reserves and bolster income in a bad year. Its steady growth was 
largely a matter of earnings management.
∙ Off–balance sheet assets and liabilities. Before its bankruptcy in 2001 (at that time, 
the second largest in U.S. history), Enron had accumulated large debts and had also 
guaranteed the debts of other companies in which it had an ownership stake. 
To present a fair view of the firm, Enron should have recognized these potential 
liabilities on its balance sheet. But the firm created and placed paper firms—
so-called special-purpose entities (SPEs)—in the middle of its transactions and 
excluded these liabilities from its financial statements.
The collapse of Enron illustrates how dishonest managers with creamy compensation packages may be tempted to conceal the truth from investors. If the company had 
been more transparent to outsiders—that is, if they could have assessed its true profitability and prospects—its problems would have shown up right away in a falling stock 
price. This in turn would have generated extra scrutiny from security analysts, bond 
rating agencies, lenders, and investors.

With transparency, corporate troubles generally lead to corrective action. But the 
top management of a troubled and opaque company may be able to maintain its stock 
price and postpone the discipline of the market. Market discipline caught up with 
Enron only a month or two before bankruptcy.
Enron was not the only company to be mired in accounting scandals in the early 
years of the century. Firms such as Global Crossing, Qwest Communications, and 
WorldCom misstated profits by billions of dollars. Overseas, the Italian dairy company Parmalat falsified the existence of a bank account to the tune of $5.5 billion, and 
the French media and entertainment company Vivendi came close to bankruptcy after 
it was accused of accounting fraud. In response to these scandals, Congress passed the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, widely known as SOX. A major goal of SOX is to increase transparency and ensure that companies and their accountants provide directors, lenders, 
and shareholders with the information they need to monitor progress.
SOX created the Public Accounting Oversight Board
