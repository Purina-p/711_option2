he companies’ incumbent managers 
naturally complain, often bitterly. Governments sometimes 
listen to such complaints. For example, in 2008 the U.S. 
government temporarily banned short sales of financial 
stocks in an attempt to halt their decline.
But defendants of short-selling argue that selling securities that one believes are overpriced is no less legitimate 
than buying those that appear underpriced. The object of a 
well-functioning market is to set the correct stock prices, not 
always higher prices. Why impede short-selling if it conveys 
truly bad news, puts pressure on poor performers, and helps 
corporate governance work?
Corporate Raiders
In the movie Pretty Woman, Richard Gere plays the role of an 
asset stripper, Edward Lewis. He buys companies, takes them 
apart, and sells the bits for more than he paid for the total 
package. In the movie Wall Street, Gordon Gekko buys a 
failing airline, Blue Star, in order to break it up and sell the 
bits. Real corporate raiders may not be as ruthless as Edward 
Lewis or Gordon Gekko, but they do target companies whose 
assets can be profitably split up and redeployed.
This has led some to complain that raiders seek to carve 
up established companies, often leaving them with heavy 
debt burdens, basically in order to get rich quick. One 
German politician has likened them to “swarms of locusts that 
fall on companies, devour all they can, and then move on.”
