most all shareholders can agree: 
Maximize the current market value of shareholders’ investment in the firm.
This simple, unqualified goal makes sense when the shareholders have access to 
well-functioning financial markets and institutions. Access gives them the flexibility 
to manage their own savings and consumption plans, leaving the corporation’s financial managers with only one task, to increase market value. For example, a corporation’s roster of shareholders will usually include both risk-averse and risk-tolerant 
investors. You might expect the risk-averse to say, “Sure, maximize value, but don’t 
touch too many high-risk projects.” Instead, they say, “Risky projects are okay, provided that expected profits are more than enough to offset the risks. If this firm ends 
up too risky for my taste, I’ll adjust my investment portfolio to make it safer.” 
For example, the risk-averse shareholder can shift more of his or her portfolio to safe 
assets, such as U.S. government bonds. Shareholders can also just say good-bye, 
selling off shares of the risky firm and buying shares in a safer one. If the risky investments increase market value, the departing shareholders are better off than they would 
be if the risky investments were turned down.
