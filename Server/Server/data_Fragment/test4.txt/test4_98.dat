 A large block of shares may give effective control even when there is no majority owner. For example, Larry 
Ellison’s billion-plus shares give him a 25% stake in Oracle. Barring some extreme catastrophe, this holding 
means that he can run the company as long as he wants to.
Most votes have endorsed compensation policy, but occasionally shareholders refuse. 
For example, in 2011 Hewlett-Packard’s shareholders voted against a $40 million compensation package for its new CEO. When there is a “no” vote, the company generally 
changes the pay package to make it less generous; other companies look anxiously over 
their shoulders to check that their compensation package is not next in the spotlight.
Corporate Governance
Financial markets and institutions are supposed to direct financing to firms that can 
invest to add value. But financing moves from investors to firms only if investors are 
protected and if agency problems within firms are absent or at least tolerable. Thus 
there is a need for a system of corporate governance so that money can flow to the 
right firms at the right times. “Corporate governance” refers to the laws, regulations, 
institutions, and corporate practices that protect shareholders and other investors. 
When scandals happen, we say that corporate governance has broken down. When 
corporations compete to deliver value to shareholders, we are comforted that corporate 
governance is working properly.
Good corporate governance relies in part on well-designed management compensation packages. Other elements of good corporate governance include the following.
Legal Requirements Good governance requires laws and regulations that protect 
investors from self-dealing by insiders. CEOs and financial managers have a fiduciary 
duty to stockholders. That is, they are required to act fairly and responsibly in the 
stockholders’ interests. If they don’t, they may end up in jail like Tyco’s Dennis 
Kozlowski and Hollinger’s Conrad Black.
Boards of Directors The board of directors appoints top managers, including the 
CEO and CFO, and must approve important financial decisions. For example, only 
the board has legal authority to approve a dividend or a public issue of securities. The 
board approves compensation schemes and awards to top management. Boards usually 
delegate decision making for small and medium-size investments, but the authority to 
approve large investments is almost never delegated.
The board of directors is elected by shareholders and is supposed to represent their 
interests. Boards have been portrayed as passive supporters of top management, but 
the balance has tipped toward independence. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) 
requires that more directors be independent—that is, not affiliated with management. 
The majority of directors are now independent. Boards must also meet in executive 
sessions with the CEO not present. SOX also requires CEOs and CFOs to sign off 
personally on the corporation’s accounting procedures and results.
Activist Shareholders Institutional shareholders, including pension funds, have 
become more active in monitoring management and pushing for changes. CEOs have 
been forced out as a result, including the CEOs of JCPenney, Procter & Gamble, Barnes 
& Noble, Citigroup, Yahoo!, and Carnival. Boards outside the United States, which 
have traditionally been more management-friendly, have also become more willing to 
replace underperformers. The list of foreign companies with CEO departures includes 
Barclays, Carrefour, Siemens, Barrick, and Rio Tinto.
Although U.S. corporations typically have thousands of individual shareholders, 
they often also have blockholders, that i
