banks in the United States.9
They vary from giants such as JPMorgan Chase with $2.6 trillion of assets to relative 
dwarfs like Cambridge Bancorp with assets of $1.7 billion.
Commercial banks are major sources of loans for corporations. (In the United 
States, they are generally not allowed to make equity investments in corporations, 
although banks in most other countries can do so.) Suppose that a local forest 
products company negotiates a 9-month bank loan for $2.5 million. The flow of 
savings is:
financial institutions
A bank, insurance 
company, or similar 
financial intermediary.

 We may be drawing too fine a distinction between financial intermediaries and institutions. A mutual fund 
could be considered a financial institution. But “financial institution” usually suggests a more complicated intermediary, such as a bank.

 Banks that accept deposits and provide financing mostly to businesses are called commercial banks. Savings 
banks and savings & loans (S&Ls) accept deposits and lend mostly to individuals, for example, as mortgage 
loans to home buyers.
10 Investment banks do not take deposits and do not lend money to businesses or individuals, except as bridge 
loans made as temporary financing for takeovers or other transactions. Investment banks are sometimes called 
merchant banks.

The bank provides debt financing for the company and, at the same time, provides 
a place for depositors to park their money safely and withdraw it as needed.
Investment Banks We have discussed commercial banks, which raise money from 
depositors and other investors and then make loans to businesses and individuals. 
Investment banks are different. Investment banks do not generally take deposits or 
make loans to companies.10 Instead, they advise and assist companies in obtaining 
finance. For example, investment banks underwrite stock offerings by purchasing the 
new shares from the issuing company at a negotiated price and reselling the shares to 
investors. Thus the issuing company gets a fixed price for the new shares, and the 
investment bank takes responsibility for distributing the shares to investors. We discuss share issues in more detail in Chapter 15.
Investment banks also advise on takeovers, mergers, and acquisitions. They offer 
investment advice and manage investment portfolios for individual and institutional 
investors. They run trading desks for foreign exchange, commodities, bonds, options, 
and other derivatives.
Investment banks can invest their own money in start-ups and other ventures. 
For example, the Australian Macquarie Bank has invested in airports, toll highways, electric transmission and generation, and other infrastructure projects around 
the world.

The largest investment banks are financial powerhouses. They include Goldman 
Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lazard, Nomura (Japan), and Macquarie Bank.11 In addition, 
the major commercial banks, including Bank of America and Citigroup, all have 
investment banking operations.12
Insurance Companies Insurance companies are more important than banks for 
the long-term financing of business. They are massive investors in corporate stocks 
and bonds, and they often make long-term loans directly to corporations.
Suppose a company needs a loan of $2.5 million for 9 years, not 9 months. It could 
issue a bond directly to investors, or it could negotiate a 9-year loan with an insurance 
company:
11 The distinction between investment and commercial banks is not a legal one. Since 2008 both Goldman Sachs 
and Morgan Stanley have held banking licenses and are supervised by the Federal Reserve. However, they are 
not in the business of taking retail deposits or providing loans.
12 Bank of America owns Merrill Lynch, one of the largest investment banks. Merrill was rescued by Bank of 
America in 2009 after making huge losses from mortgage-related investments.

The money to make the loan comes mainly from the sale of insurance policies. Say 
you buy a fire insurance policy on your home. You pay cash to the insurance company 
and get a financial asset (the policy) in exchange. You recei
