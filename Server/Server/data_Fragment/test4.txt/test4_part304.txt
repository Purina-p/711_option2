TABLE 3.7 Personal tax 
rates, 2016
When firms make profits, they pay 35% of the profits to the Internal Revenue 
Service. But the process doesn’t work in reverse; if the firm suffers a loss, the IRS does 
not send it a check for 35% of the loss. However, the firm can carry the losses back, 
deduct them from taxable income in earlier years, and claim a refund of past taxes. 
Losses can also be carried forward and deducted from taxable income in the future.14
Personal Tax
Table 3.7 shows the U.S. rates of personal tax. Notice that as income increases, the 
tax rate also increases. Notice also that the top personal tax rate is higher than the top 
corporate rate.
The tax rates presented in Table 3.7 are marginal tax rates. The marginal tax rate 
is the tax that the individual pays on each extra dollar of income. For example, as a 
single taxpayer, you would pay 10 cents of tax on each extra dollar you earn when your 
income is below $9,275, but once income exceeds $9,275, you would pay 15 cents of 
tax on each extra dollar of income up to an income of $37,650. If your total income is 
$50,000, your tax bill is 10% of the first $9,275 of income, 15% of the next $28,375 
(i.e., 37,650 − 9,275), and 25% of the remaining $12,350:
Tax = (.10 × $9,275) + (.15 × $28,375) + (.25 × $12,350) = $8,271.25
