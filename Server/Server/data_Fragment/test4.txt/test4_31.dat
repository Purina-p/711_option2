n 2000. At the same time, large balance-of-payments surpluses in Asian economies were invested back into U.S. debt securities. This also 
helped to push down interest rates and contribute to lax credit.
Banks took advantage of this cheap money to expand the supply of subprime mortgages to low-income borrowers. Many banks tempted would-be homeowners with low 
initial payments, offset by significantly higher payments later.18 (Some home buyers 
were betting on escalating housing prices so that they could resell or refinance before 
the higher payments kicked in.) One lender is even said to have advertised what it 
dubbed its “NINJA” loan—NINJA standing for “No Income, No Job, and No Assets.” 
Most subprime mortgages were then packaged together into mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) that could be resold. But, instead of selling these securities to investors 
who could best bear the risk, many banks kept large quantities of the loans on their 
own books or sold them to other banks.
The widespread availability of mortgage finance fueled a dramatic increase in 
house prices, which doubled in the 5 years ending June 2006. At that point, prices 
started to slide and homeowners began to default on their mortgages. A year later, 
Bear Stearns, a large investment bank, announced huge losses on the mortgage investments that were held in two of its hedge funds. By the spring of 2008, Bear Stearns 
was on the verge of bankruptcy, and the U.S. Federal Reserve arranged for it to be 
acquired by JPMorgan Chase.
The crisis peaked in September 2008, when the U.S. government was obliged to take 
over the giant federal mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which 
had invested several hundred billion dollars in subprime mortgage-backed securities. 
Over the next few days, the financial system started to melt down. Both Merrill Lynch 
and Lehman Brothers were in danger of failing. On September 14, the government 
arranged for Bank of America to take over Merrill in return for financial guarantees. 
However, it did nothing to rescue Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy protection the next day. Two days later, the government reluctantly lent $85 billion to the 
giant insurance company AIG, which had insured huge volumes of mortgage-backed 
securities and other bonds against default. The following day, the Treasury unveiled its 
first proposal to spend $700 billion to purchase “toxic” mortgage-backed securities.
After the failure of Lehman and the forced rescues of Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie 
Mac, Merrill Lynch, and AIG, investors and financial institutions had to ask, “Who will 
be next? Do I dare trade with or lend money to Bank X?” In many situations, the cautious 
answer was “No.” Customary day-to-day financial transactions were canceled or completed on onerous terms.19 At the same time, trading in MBSs and other hard-to-value 
securities dried up; it therefore became even harder to know what these securities were 
worth. As banks and other financial institutions became reluctant to trade securities or 
lend to one another, the supply of credit to the economy contracted and business investment was cut back. The U.S. economy suffered one of its worst setbacks since the Great 
Depression. Unemployment rose rapidly and business bankruptcies tripled.
2.4
18 With a so-called option ARM loan, the minimum mortgage payment was often not even sufficient to cover 
that month’s interest on the loan. The unpaid interest was then added to the amount of the mortgage, so the 
homeowner was burdened by an ever-increasing mortgage that one day would need to be paid off.
19  The interest rate on interbank loans rose in 2008 to 4.6% above the rate on U.S. Treasury debt. The normal 
spread over Treasuries is less than .5%.

Few developed economies escaped the crisis. As well as suffering from a collapse in 
their own housing markets, a number of foreign banks had made large investments in 
U.S. subprime mortgages and had to be rescued by their governments. Many European 
governments were already heavily in debt and, as the cost of the bank bailouts mounted, 
investors began to worry about the ability of the governments to repay their debts. 
Thus in Europe, the banking crisis became entwined with a sovereign debt crisis.
The invention of MBSs also made mortgages liquid. They 
are actively traded among banks, insurance companies, 
mutual funds, pension funds, and endowments.
The MBS market has grown explosively. With the growth 
came more and more complexity. Issuers were not content 
with the simple pass-through MBS described earlier. They 
issued complicated packages of securities called tranches.
The most senior tranches were given first call on all cash 
flows from the mortgage portfolio and were viewed as almost 
risk-free. Bond-rating agencies gave their highest, triple-A ratings to the senior tranches, even for MBSs based on subprime mortgages for homeowners with weak credit. Many 
investors in triple-A tranches lost a lot of money in the crisis of 
2007–2009. We discuss bond ratings in Chapter 6.
The MBS market survived. It is still by far the largest source 
of mortgage financing. By 2015, the aggregate MBSs outstanding exceeded $2 trillion. MBSs are part of a broader 
market for asset-backed securities, which include securities 
that work like MBSs but are based on portfolios of other types 
of assets, including car loans, bank loans to businesses, and 
financing for commercial real estate.
Mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) provide another example of how financial markets convey savings to finance 
investment in real assets. In this case, the real assets 
are homes, which homeowners finance in part with mortgage loans.
In the old days—the 1960s, for example—most mortgage 
loans were made by local banks, savings banks, and savings 
and loan institutions (S&Ls), which accepted deposits and savings accounts and made mortgage and other local loans. We 
will use an S&L as the example. The flow of savings would be 
as described by the figure in Panel a, at the bottom of this box.
The typical mortgage was long term, up to 30 years maturity, with a fixed interest rate. The S&Ls’ liabilities—chiefly savings accounts—had much shorter maturities, perhaps a year 
or two on average. The S&Ls were therefore “borrowing 
short, lending long,” a dangerous investment strategy. When 
interest rates rose in the 1970s and 1980s, the S&Ls’ interest 
costs on savings accounts rose, too, but their interest income 
was locked up in long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. Losses 
mounted. The S&L crisis of the 1980s followed.*
The invention of the MBS allowed S&Ls to eliminate the risks 
of borrowing short and lending long. You can still get a mortgage 
from your local S&L, but now the S&L does not have to keep it. 
The S&L originates the mortgage, but will probably resell it to an 
MBS issuer—for example, Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association or FNMA†) or Bank of America. The issuer combines your mortgage with hundreds or thousands of others and 
issues an MBS backed by the combined portfolio. The MBS is 
sold to investors such as life insurance companies that want to 
hold long-term, fixed-rate obligations. Cash flows from the mortgage portfolio are passed through to investors.‡
Suppose a life insurance company purchases an MBS. The 
flow of savings would now match the figure in Panel b.
Finance in Practice Mortgage-Backed Securities
*For a history of the crisis, see Edward J. Kane, The S&L Insurance Mess: How 
Did It Happen? (Washington, D.C.: Urban Institute Press, 1989).
†Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) are 
government-sponsored entities (GSEs) charged with increasing the availability 
of mortgage credit. The GSEs purchase “conforming loans” and package and 
resell them as MBSs. Nonconforming loans—for example, large, “jumbo” 
mortgages—are packaged by banks such as Citigroup or Bank of America.
‡ You still send monthly payments to your local S&L. The S&L extracts a small 
servicing fee and sends your payments along to the MBS issuer, which also 
extracts a small servicing fee. Net cash flows from the portfolio of mortgages 
then go to the MBS investors.

Chapter 2 Financial Markets and Institutions 51
bre22619_ch02_032-055.indd 51 10/06/16 03:41 PM
Greece was in the worst shape. It had accumulated €350 billion (about $460 billion) 
of government debt. Greece is a member of the single-currency euro club, so it had no 
control over its currency and could not just print more euros to service its debts. In 
2011 it defaulted on debts totaling €100 billion.
Greece was still on shaky ground in early 2016, despite a series of rescue packages 
from the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary 
Fund. Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and other European countries that had also worried 
investors avoided default and seemed to be recovering. But unemployment in many 
European countries remained stubbornly high and economic growth anemic.
What lessons can you, as a student of finance, draw from these financial crises? 
Here are three. First, note the sorry consequences for the economy when financial 
markets and institutions do not carry out the functions described in this chapter. For 
example, the crisis was amplified by the sudden disappearance of liquidity in many 
markets, including the market for MBSs. That meant that potential buyers of the illiquid assets could not know for sure what they were worth. Thus, the informational function of financial markets was also compromised.
Second, why were Bear Stearns, Lehman, Merrill Lynch, and the other distressed 
firms so fragile? One reason is that they were mostly financed with borrowed money, 
much of it short-term debt that had to be refinanced frequently. Investment banks like 
Lehman typically were financed with more than 95% debt and less than 5% equity 
capital. Thus a 5% fall in their asset values could wipe out their equity “cushions” and 
leave the banks insolvent. Regulators since the crisis have therefore required banks to 
finance with much more equity. This requirement has also affected payout to shareholders. A U.S. bank’s dividend payments can be stopped by regulators if the bank’s 
equity capital ratio is not up to snuff. We cover decisions about debt versus equity 
financing and payout in Chapters 16 and 17.
Third, some causes of the crisis can be traced back to agency problems noted in 
Chapter 1. Managers in the mortgage business were probably at least dimly aware that 
promoting and selling massive amounts of subprime MBSs was likely to end badly. 
They didn’t wake up in the morning thinking, “Hey, maybe I can cause a financial 
crisis,” but their incentives did call for trying to squeeze out one more fat bonus before 
the game ended. Their incentives were not aligned with shareholders’. The value of 
their firms suffered accordingly.
SUMMARY
The ultimate source of financing is individuals’ savings. The savings may flow through 
financial markets and intermediaries. The intermediaries include mutual funds, pension 
funds, and financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies.
It’s simple: Corporations need access to financing in order to innovate and grow. A modern 
financial system offers different types of financing, depending on a corporation’s age and 
the nature of its business. A high-tech start-up will seek venture capital financing, for 
example. A mature firm will rely more on bond markets.
In that case, the corporation is saving on behalf of its shareholders.
Mutual and pension funds allow investors to diversify in professionally managed portfolios. Pension funds offer an additional tax advantage, because the returns on pension 
investments are not taxed until withdrawn from the plan.

52 Part One Introduction
bre22619_ch02_032-055.indd 52 10/06/16 03:41 PM
Financial markets help channel savings to corporate investment, and they help match up 
borrowers and lenders. They provide liquidity and diversification opportunities for investors. Trading in financial markets provides a wealth of useful information for the financial 
manager.
Financial institutions carry out a number of similar functions to financial markets but in 
different ways. They channel savings to corporate investment, and they serve as financial 
intermediaries between borrowers and lenders. Banks also provide liquidity for depositors and, of course, play a special role in the economy’s payment systems. Insurance companies allow policyholders to pool risks.
The financial crisis of 2007–2009 provided a dramatic illustration. The huge expansion in 
subprime mortgage lending in the United States led to a collapse of the banking system. 
The government was forced into costly bailouts of banks and other financial institutions. 
As the credit markets seized up, the country suffered a deep recession. In much of Europe, 
the financial crisis did not end in 2009. As governments struggled to reduce their debt 
mountains and to strengthen their banking systems, many countries suffered sharp falls in 
economic activity and severe unemployment.

secondary market.
b. The capital market is for long-term financing; the money market, for short-term 
financing.
c. The market for stocks versus the market for bonds and other debt securities.

PART ONE Introduction

bre22619_ch03_056-085.indd 57 10/07/16 03:18 PM
I
n Chapter 1 we pointed out that a large corporation is 
a team effort. All the players—the shareholders, lenders, directors, management, and employees—have a 
stake in the company’s success, and all therefore need 
to monitor its progress. For this reason, the company 
prepares regular financial accounts and arranges for an 
independent firm of auditors to certify that these 
accounts present a “true and fair view.”
Until the mid-nineteenth century, most businesses 
were owner-managed and seldom re
