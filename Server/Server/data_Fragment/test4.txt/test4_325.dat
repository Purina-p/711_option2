is $100 million, firm A, which has $40 million of interest expense, has lower pretax 
income and therefore pays less taxes.
The bad news about taxes is that each extra dollar of revenue increases taxable 
income by $1 and results in 35 cents of extra taxes. The good news is that each extra 
dollar of expense reduces taxable income by $1 and therefore reduces taxes by 
35 cents. For example, if the firm borrows money, every dollar of interest it pays on 
the loan reduces taxes by 35 cents. Therefore, a dollar of interest reduces after-tax 
income by only 65 cents.
14 Losses can be carried back for a maximum of 3 years and forward for up to 15 years.

TABLE 3.7 Personal tax 
rates, 2016
When firms make profits, they pay 35% of the profits to the Internal Revenue 
Service. But the process doesnâ€™t work in reverse; if the firm suffers a loss, the IRS does 
not send it a check for 35% of the loss. However, the firm can carry the losses back, 
deduct them from taxable income in earlier years, and claim a refund of past taxes. 
Losses can also be carried forward and deducted from taxable income in the future.14
