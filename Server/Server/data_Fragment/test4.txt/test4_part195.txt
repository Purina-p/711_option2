ands. Normally the incidence 
of fires “averages out,” leaving the company with a predictable obligation to its policyholders as a group. Of course, the insurance company must charge enough for its policies to cover selling and administrative costs, pay policyholders’ claims, and generate 
a profit for its stockholders.
Total Financing of U.S. Corporations
The pie chart in Figure 2.3 shows the investors in bonds and other debt securities. 
Notice the importance of institutional investors—mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and banks. Households (individual investors) hold less than 5% of the 
debt pie. The other slices represent the rest of the world (investors from outside the 
United States) and other, smaller categories of investors.
The pie chart in Figure 2.4 shows holdings of the shares issued by U.S. corporations. Here, households make a stronger showing, with 37.2% of the total. Pension

funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds add up to 45.9% of the total. Remember, banks in the United States do not usually hold stock in other companies. The restof-the-world slice is 16.0%.
The aggregate amounts represented in these figures are enormous. There is 
$11.9 trillion of debt behind Figure 2.3 and $34.1 trillion of equity behind Figure 2.4 
($34,100,000,000,000).
Chapter 14 reviews corporate financing patterns in more detail.
Functions of Financial Markets 
and Intermediaries
Financial markets and intermediaries provide financing for business. They channel 
savings to real investment. That much should be loud and clear from Sections 2.1 and 
2.2 of this chapter. But there are other functions that may not be quite so obvious.

Transporting Cash across Time
Individuals need to transport expenditures in time. If you have money now that you 
wish to save for a rainy day, you can (for example) put the money in a savings account 
at a bank and withdraw it with interest later. If you don’t have money today, say to buy 
a car, you can borrow money from the bank and pay off the loan later. Modern finance 
provides a kind of time machine. Lenders transport money forward in time; borrowers 
transport it back. Both are happier than if they were forced to spend income as it 
arrives. Of course, individuals are not alone in needing to raise cash from time to time. 
Firms with good investment opportunities, but a shortage of internally generated cash, 
raise cash by borrowing or selling new shares. Many governments run deficits and 
finance current outlays by issuing debt.
Young people saving for retirement may transport their current earnings 30 or 40 
years into the future by means of a pension fund. They can even transport income to 
their heirs
