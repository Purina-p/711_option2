 no definite maturity. Bonds and other debt 
securities can vary in maturity, in the degree of protection or collateral offered by the 
issuer, and in the level and timing of interest payments. Some bonds make “floating” 
interest payments tied to the future level of interest rates. Many can be “called” (repurchased and retired) by the issuing company before the bonds’ stated maturity date. 
Some bonds can be converted into other securities, usually the stock of the issuing 
company. You don’t need to master these distinctions now; just be aware that the debt 
or fixed-income market is a complicated and challenging place. A corporation must 
not only decide between debt and equity finance. It must also consider the design of 
debt.
