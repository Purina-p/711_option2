e both owners and 
managers, reaping the rewards of good decisions and hard work and suffering when 
they make bad decisions or slack off. Their personal wealth is tied to the value of their 
businesses.
In most large corporations, the owners are mostly outside investors, and so the 
managers may be tempted to act in their own interests rather than maximize shareholder value. For example, they may shy away from valuable but risky investment 
projects because they worry more about job security than maximizing value. They 
may build empires by overaggressive investment or overconfident acquisitions of 
other companies.
The temptation for such value-destroying actions arises because the managers are 
not the shareholders, but agents of the shareholders. Therefore, the actions are called 
agency problems. Losses in value from agency problems—or from costs incurred to 
mitigate the problems—are called agency costs.
Agency problems sometimes lead to outrageous behavior. When Dennis 
Kozlowski, the former CEO of Tyco, threw a $2 million birthday bash for his wife, 
he charged half the cost to the company. Conrad Black, the former boss of Hollinger 
International, used the company jet for a trip with his wife to Bora Bora. These, of 
course, are extreme examples. The agency problems encountered in the ordinary 
course of business are often subtle and mundane. But agency problems do arise 
whenever managers think just a little less hard about spending money that is not 
their own.
