To grow from small beginnings to a major corporation, FedEx needed to make good investment and financing decisions.

To carry on business, a corporation needs an 
almost endless variety of assets. Some are tangible assets such as plant and machinery, office 
buildings, and vehicles; others are intangible assets 
such as brand names and patents. Corporations finance 
these assets by borrowing, by reinvesting profits back 
into the firm, and by selling additional shares to the 
firm’s shareholders.
Financial managers, therefore, face two broad questions. First, what investments should the corporation 
make? Second, how should it pay for these investments? 
Investment decisions spend money. Financing decisions raise money for investment.
We start this chapter with examples of recent investment and financing decisions by major U.S. and foreign 
corporations. We review what a corporation is and 
describe the roles of its top financial managers. We then 
turn to the financial goal of the corporation, which is 
usually expressed as maximizing value, or at least 
adding value. Financial managers add value whenever 
the corporation can invest to earn a higher return than 
its shareholders can earn for themselves.
But managers are human beings; they cannot be 
perfect servants who always and everywhere maximize 
value. We will consider the conflicts of interest that 
arise in large corporations and how corporate governance helps to align the interests of managers and 
shareholders.
If we ask managers to maximize value, can the corporation also be a good citizen? Won’t the managers be 
tempted to try unethical or illegal financial tricks? They 
may sometimes be tempted, but wise managers realize 
that such tricks are not just dishonest; they almost 
always destroy value, not increase it. More challenging 
are the gray areas where the line between ethical and 
unethical financial actions is hard to draw.
Finally, we look ahead to the rest of this book and look 
back to some entertaining snippets of financial history.
