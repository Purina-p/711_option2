thquakes can 
damage thousands of homes at once. The potential losses are so great that property insurance companies buy 
reinsurance against such catastrophes.
14 ETFs are in this respect like closed-end mutual funds (see footnote 3). But ETFs do not have managers with 
the discretion to try to “pick winners.” ETF portfolios are tied down to indexes or fixed baskets of securities. 
ETF issuers make sure that the ETF price tracks the price of the underlying index or basket.

Financial markets provide other mechanisms for sharing risks. For example, a 
wheat farmer and a baking company are each exposed to fluctuations in the price of 
wheat after the harvest. The farmer worries about low prices, the baker about high 
prices. They can both rest easier if the baker can agree with the farmer to buy wheat in 
the future at a fixed price. Of course, it would be difficult, to say the least, if the baker 
and the farmer had to contact an Internet dating service to get together to make a deal.

farmer as a seller and the baker as a buyer.
