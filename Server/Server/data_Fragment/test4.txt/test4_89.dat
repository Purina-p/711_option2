Notice that the opportunity cost of capital depends on the risk of the proposed 
investment project. Why? It’s not just because shareholders are risk-averse. It’s also 
because shareholders have to trade off risk against return when they invest on their 
own. The safest investments, such as U.S. government debt, offer low rates of return. 
Investments with higher expected rates of return—the stock market, for example—are 
riskier and sometimes deliver painful losses. (The U.S. stock market fell 38% in 2008, 
for example.) Other investments are riskier still. For example, high-tech growth stocks 
offer the prospect of higher rates of return than typical stocks but are also more volatile 
than typical stocks.
Managers look to the financial markets to measure the opportunity cost of capital 
for the firm’s investment projects. They can observe the opportunity cost of capital for 
safe investments by looking up current interest rates on safe debt securities. For risky 
investments, the opportunity cost of capital has to be estimated. We start to tackle this 
task in Chapter 11.
