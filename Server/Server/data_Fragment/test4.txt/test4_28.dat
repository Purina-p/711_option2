ntrast, the European Union takes a principles-based approach to accounting. Its International Financial Reporting Standards set out general approaches that 
financial statements should take to valuing assets. Europe and the United States have 
been engaged for years in attempts to coordinate their systems, and many in the United 
States have lobbied for the greater simplicity that principles-based accounting 
standards might offer. The nearby box reports on these efforts.
Taxes
Taxes often have a major effect on financial decisions. Therefore, we should explain 
how corporations and investors are taxed.
Corporate Tax
Companies pay tax on their income. Table 3.5 shows that there are special low rates of 
corporate tax for small companies, but for large companies (those with income over 
$18.33 million) the corporate tax rate is 35%.12 Thus for every $100 that the firm earns 
it pays $35 in corporate tax.
When firms calculate taxable income, they are allowed to deduct expenses. These 
expenses include an allowance for depreciation. However, the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) specifies the rates of depreciation that the company can use for different 
types of equipment. The rates of depreciation used to calculate taxes are not the same 
as the rates used when the firm reports its profits to shareholders.13
The company is also allowed to deduct interest paid to debtholders when calculating its taxable income, but dividends paid to shareholders are not deductible. These 
dividends are therefore paid out of after-tax income. Table 3.6 provides an example of 
how interest payments reduce corporate taxes. Although EBIT for both firms A and B

Tax (35% of pretax income) 21 35
Net income $ 39 $ 65
TABLE 3.6 Firms A and B both 
have earnings before interest 
and taxes (EBIT) of $100 million, 
but A pays out part of its profits 
as debt interest. This reduces the 
corporate tax paid by A.
Note: Figures in millions of dollars.
12 In addition, corporations pay state income taxes, which we ignore here for simplicity.
13 If the company assumes a slower rate of depreciation in its income statement than the Internal Revenue 
Service assumes, the tax charge shown in the income statement will be higher in the early years of a project’s 
life than the actual tax payment. This difference is recorded in the balance sheet as a liability for deferred tax. 
We will tell you more about depreciation allowances in Chapter 9.

is $100 million, firm A, which has $40 million of interest expense, has lower pretax 
income and therefore pays less taxes.
The bad news about taxes is that each extra dollar of revenue increases taxable 
income by $1 and results in 35 cents of extra taxes. The good news is that each extra 
dollar of expense reduces taxable income by $1 and therefore reduces taxes by 
35 cents. For example, if the firm borrows money, every dollar of interest it pays on 
the loan reduces taxes by 35 cents. Therefore, a dollar of interest reduces after-tax 
income by only 65 cents.
14 Losses can be carried back for a maximum of 3 years and forward for up to 15 years.

TABLE 3.7 Personal tax 
rates, 2016
When firms make profits, they pay 35% of the profits to the Internal Revenue 
Service. But the process doesn’t work in reverse; if the firm suffers a loss, the IRS does 
not send it a check for 35% of the loss. However, the firm can carry the losses back, 
deduct them from taxable income in earlier years, and claim a refund of past taxes. 
Losses can also be carried forward and deducted from taxable income in the future.14
Personal Tax
Table 3.7 shows the U.S. rates of personal tax. Notice that as income increases, the 
tax rate also increases. Notice also that the top personal tax rate is higher than the top 
corporate rate.
The tax rates presented in Table 3.7 are marginal tax rates. The marginal tax rate 
is the tax that the individual pays on each extra dollar of income. For example, as a 
single taxpayer, you would pay 10 cents of tax on each extra dollar you earn when your 
income is below $9,275, but once income exc
