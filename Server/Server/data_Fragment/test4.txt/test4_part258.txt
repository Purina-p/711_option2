ook values 
of the assets shown in the balance sheet and their market values.
Items in the balance sheet are valued according to generally accepted accounting 
principles, commonly called GAAP. These state that assets must be shown in the balance sheet at their historical cost adjusted for depreciation. Book values are therefore 
“backward-looking” measures of value. They are based on the past cost of the asset, 
not its current market price or value to the firm. For example, suppose that 2 years 
ago Home Depot built an office building for $30 million and that in today’s market 
the building would sell for $40 million. The book value of the building would be less 
than its market value, and the balance sheet would understate the value of Home 
Depot’s asset.
Or consider a specialized plant that Intel develops for producing special-purpose 
computer chips at a cost of $800 million. The book value of the plant is $800 million 
less accumulated depreciation. But suppose that shortly after the plant is constructed, 
a new chip makes the existing one obsolete. The market value of Intel’s new plant 
could fall by 50% or more. In this case, market value would be less than book value.
The difference between book value and market value is greater for some assets than 
for others. It is zero in the case of cash but potentially very large for fixed assets where 
the accountant starts with initial cost and then depreciates that figure according to a 
prespecified schedule. The purpose of depreciation is to allocate the original cost of 
the asset over its life, and the rules governing the depreciation of asset values do not 
reflect actual loss of market value. Usually the market value of fixed assets is much 
higher than the book value, but sometimes it is less.

The same goes for the right-hand side of the balance sheet. In the case of liabilities, 
the accountant simply records the amount of money that you have promised to pay. 
For short-term liabilities, this figure is generally close to the market value of that 
promise. For example, if you owe the bank $1 million tomorrow, the accounts show a 
book liability of $1 million. As long as you are not bankrupt, that $1 million is also 
roughly the value to the bank of your promise. But now suppose that $1 million is not 
due to be repaid for several years. The accounts still show a liability of $1 million, but 
how much your debt is worth depends on what happens to interest rates. If interest 
rates rise after you have issued the debt, lenders may not be prepared to pay as much 
as $1 million for your debt; if interest rates fall, they may be prepared to pay more than 
$1 million.4
 Thus the market value of a long-term liability may be higher or lower 
than the book value. Market values of assets and liabilities do not generally equal 
their book values. Book values are based on historical or original values. Market 
values measure current values of assets and liabilities.
The difference between book value and market value is likely to be greatest for 
shareholders’ equity. The book value of equity measures the cash that shareholders 
have contributed in the past plus the cash that the company has retained and reinvested 
in the business on their behalf. But this often bears little resemblance to the total market value that investors place on the shares.
If the market price of the firm’s shares falls through the floor, don’t try telling the 
shareholders that the book value is satisfactory—they won’t want to hear. Shareholders are concerned with the market value of their shares; market value, not book value, 
is the
