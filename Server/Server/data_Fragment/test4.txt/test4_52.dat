res outstanding. Therefore Microsoft’s market value—its market capitalization or market cap—was 53 × 7.91 = $419 billion. Where did this market value come 
from? It came from Microsoft’s products, from its brand name and worldwide customer base, from its R&D, and from its ability to make profitable future investments. 
It did not come from sophisticated financing. Microsoft’s financing strategy is very 
simple: It finances almost all investment by retaining and reinvesting operating cash flow.
Financing decisions may not add much value compared to good investment decisions, but they can destroy value if they are stupid or ambushed by bad news. For 
example, when a consortium of investment companies bought the energy giant TXU in 
2007, the company took on an additional $40 billion in debt. This may not have been a 
stupid decision, but it did prove fatal. The consortium did not foresee the expansion of 
shale gas production and the resulting sharp fall in natural gas and electricity prices, 
and in April 2014 the company (renamed Energy Future Holdings) was bankrupt.
We have emphasized the financial manager’s responsibility for two decisions:
The investment decision = purchase of real assets
The financing decision = sale of financial assets
But this is an oversimplification because the financial manager is also involved in many 
other day-to-day activities that are essential to the smooth operation of a business. 
Are the following capital budgeting or financing decisions? (Hint: In one case the 
answer is “both.”)
a. Intel decides to spend $7 billion to develop a new microprocessor factory.
b. BMW borrows 350 million euros (€350 million) from Deutsche Bank.
c. Royal Dutch Shell constructs a pipeline to bring natural gas onshore from a 
production platform in Australia.
d. Avon spends €200 million to launch a new range of cosmetics in European 
markets.
e. Pfizer issues new shares to buy a small biotech company.
