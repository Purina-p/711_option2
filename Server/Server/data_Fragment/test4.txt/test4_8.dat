The answer depends on the rate of return on the investment project and on the rate of 
return that stockholders can earn by investing in financial markets. If the return offered 
by the investment project is higher than the rate of return that shareholders can get by 
investing on their own, then the shareholders would vote for the investment project. 
If the investment project offers a lower return than shareholders can achieve on their 
own, the shareholders would vote to cancel the project and take the cash instead.
Figure 1.3 could apply to Virgin Atlantic’s decisions to invest in new aircraft. 
Suppose the company has cash set aside to buy five more Airbus A350-1000s. It could 
go ahead with the purchase, or it could choose to cancel the investment and instead pay 
out the cash to its stockholders. If it pays out the cash, the stockholders could then 
invest for themselves.
Suppose that Virgin’s investment in new planes is just about as risky as the stock 
market and that investment in the stock market offers a 10% expected rate of return. 
If the new planes offer a superior rate of return, say 20%, then Virgin’s stockholders 
would be happy to let the company keep the cash and invest it in the new planes. 
If the planes offer only a 5% return, then the stockholders are better off with the cash 
and without the new project; in that case, the financial manager should turn down 
the project.
As long as a corporation’s proposed investments offer higher rates of return than its 
shareholders can earn for themselves in the stock market (or in other financial 
markets), its shareholders will applaud the investments and the market value of the 
firm will increase. But if the company earns an inferior return, shareholders boo, 
market value falls, and stockholders clamor to get their money back so that they can 
invest on their own.
In our example, the minimum acceptable rate of return on Virgin’s new aircraft 
is 10%. This minimum rate of return is called the hurdle rate or opportunity cost of 
capital. It is called an opportunity cost of capital because it depends on the alternative 
investment opportunities available to shareholders in financial markets. Whenever a 
corporation invests cash in a new project, its shareholders lose the opportunity to 
invest the cash on their own. Corporations increase value by accepting investment 
projects that earn more than the opportunity cost of capital.
Figure 1.3, which compares rates of return on investment projects with the opportunity cost of capital, illustrates a general principle: A corporation should direct cash to 
investments that add market value, compared with the investments that shareholders 
could make on their own.7

 We have mentioned 5% or 20% as possible future rates of return on Virgin Atlantic’s new planes. We will see 
in Chapter 8 that future rates of return are sometimes difficult to calculate and interpret. The general 
principle always holds, however. In Chapters 8 and 9 we show you how to apply the principle by calculating 
the net present value (NPV) of investment projects.

Notice that the opportunity cost of capital depends on the risk of the proposed 
investment project. Why? It’s not just because shareholders are risk-averse. It’s also 
because shareholders have to trade off risk against return when they invest on their 
own. The safest investments, such as U.S. government debt, offer low rates of return. 
Investments with higher expected rates of return—the stock market, for example—are 
riskier and sometimes deliver painful losses. (The U.S. stock market fell 38% in 2008, 
for example.) Other investments are riskier still. For example, high-tech growth stocks 
offer the prospect of higher rates of return than typical stocks but are also more volatile 
than typical stocks.
Managers look to the financial markets to measure the opportunity cost of capital 
for the firm’s investment projects. They can observe the opportunity cost of capital for 
safe investments by looking up current interest rates on safe debt securities. For risky 
investments, the opportunity cost of capital has to be estimated. We start to tackle this 
task in Chapter 11.
1.5 Agency Problems, Executive Compensation, 
and Corporate Governance
Sole proprietors face no conflicts in financial management. They are both owners and 
managers, reaping the rewards of good decisions and hard work and suffering when 
they make bad decisions or slack off. Their personal wealth is tied to the value of their 
businesses.
In most large corporations, the owners are mostly outside investors, and so the 
managers may be tempted to act in their own interests rather than maximize shareholder value. For example, they may shy away from valuable but risky investment 
projects because they worry more about job security than maximizing value. They 
may build empires by overaggressive investment or overconfident acquisitions of 
other companies.
The temptation for such value-destroying actions arises because the managers are 
not the shareholders, but agents of the shareholders. Therefore, the actions are called 
agency problems. Losses in value from agency problems—or from costs incurred to 
mitigate the problems—are called agency costs.
Agency problems sometimes lead to outrageous behavior. When Dennis 
Kozlowski, the former CEO of Tyco, threw a $2 million birthday bash for his wife, 
he charged half the cost to the company. Conrad Black, the former boss of Hollinger 
International, used the company jet for a trip with his wife to Bora Bora. These, of 
course, are extreme examples. The agency problems encountered in the ordinary 
course of business are often subtle and mundane. But agency problems do arise 
whenever managers think just a little less hard about spending money that is not 
their own.

Investing $100,000 in additional raw materials, mostly palladium, should allow 
Cryogenic Concepts to increase production and earn an additional $112,000 
next year. This payoff could cover the investment, plus a 12% return. Palladium is 
traded in commodity markets. The CFO has studied the history of returns from 
investments in palladium and believes that investors in the precious metal 
can reasonably expect a 15% return. What is the opportunity cost of capital? 
Is Cryogenic’s proposed investment in palladium a good idea? Why or why not?

Think of the corporation’s value as a pie that is divided among several classes of 
claimants. These include managers and workers as well as shareholders and lenders. 
The government is a claimant, too, because it taxes sales and profits. The claimants are 
called stakeholders because each has a stake in the firm. Agency problems arise 
whenever the stakeholders’ interests do not coincide.

interest in the corporation.

 Most restricted stock does not “vest” immediately. Suppose the vesting period is 3 years. If the manager quits 
or is fired in year 2, the restricted stock stays behind. Vesting gives the managers an incentive to stay at the 
corporation, in this example, for at least 3 years.
Agency problems are controlled in practice in three ways. First, corporations set up 
internal controls and decision-making procedures to prevent wasteful spending and 
discourage careless investment. We discuss the controls and procedures in several later 
chapters. For example, Chapters 8, 9, and 10 cover procedures for disciplined, valuemaximizing capital investment decisions. Second, corporations try to design compensation schemes that align managers’ and shareholders’ interests. Third, the corporations 
are constrained by corporate governance. We comment on compensation and governance here.
Executive Compensation
The compensation packages of top executives are almost always tied to the financial 
performance of their companies. The package typically includes a fixed base salary 
plus an annual award tied to earnings or other measures of financial performance. 
The more senior the manager, the smaller the base salary as a fraction of total compensation. Also, compensation is not all in cash, but partly in shares. The shares are 
usually restricted stock, which the manager is required to hold onto while employed 
by the corporation.8
 Many corporations also include stock options in compensation 
packages. Stock options, which we cover in Chapter 23, give especially powerful 
incentives to maximize stock price per share.
The upside compensation potential for a few top managers is enormous. For example, Larry Ellison, CEO of the business software giant Oracle, received total compensation of $64 million for 2015. Only $1 of that amount was base salary. The rest came 
from grants of stock and options. The options will be worthless if Oracle’s stock price 
falls from its 2015 level but will pay off handsomely if the price rises. In addition, as a 
founder of Oracle, Ellison owns shares worth $49 billion. No one can say for certain 
how hard Ellison would have worked with a different compensation package, but one 
thing is clear: He has a huge personal stake in Oracle’s market value.
Well-designed compensation schemes alleviate agency problems by encouraging 
managers to maximize shareholder wealth. But some schemes are not well designed; 
they reward managers even when value is destroyed. For example, during Robert 
Nardelli’s 6-year tenure as CEO, Home Depot’s stock price fell by 20% while shares of 
its rival Lowe’s nearly doubled. When Nardelli was ousted in January 2007, he received 
a farewell package worth $210 million. Needless to say, many shareholders were livid.
In 2010, the Dodd-Frank financial reform law gave U.S. shareholders the right to 
express their opinion on executive compensation through nonbinding “say on pay” 
votes at 1- or 3-year intervals. (Shareholders of U.K. companies have a similar right.) 
What are agency problems and agency costs? Give two or three examples of 
decisions by managers that can lead to agency costs.

 A large block of shares may give effective control even when there is no majority owner. For example, Larry 
Ellison’s billion-plus shares give him a 25% stake in Oracle. Barring some extreme catastrophe, this holding 
means that he can run the company as long as he wants to.
Most votes have endorsed compensation policy, but occasionally shareholders refuse. 
For example, in 2011 Hewlett-Packard’s shareholders voted against a $40 million compensation package for its new CEO. When there is a “no” vote, the company generally 
changes the pay package to make it less generous; other companies look anxiously over 
their shoulders to check that their compensation package is not next in the spotlight.
Corporate Governance
Financial markets and institutions are supposed to direct financing to firms that can 
invest to add value. But financing moves from investors to firms only if investors are 
protected and if agency problems within firms are absent or at least tolerable. Thus 
there is a need for a system of corporate governance so that money can flow to the 
right firms at the right times. “Corporate governance” refers to the laws, regulations, 
institutions, and corporate practices that protect shareholders and other investors. 
When scandals happen, we say that corporate governance has broken down. When 
corporations compete to deliver value to shareholders, we are comforted that corporate 
governance is working properly.
Good corporate governance relies in part on well-designed management compensation packages. Other elements of good corporate governance include the following.
Legal Requirements Good governance requires laws and regulations that protect 
investors from self-dealing by insiders. CEOs and financial managers have a fiduciary 
duty to stockholders. That is, they are required to act fairly and responsibly in the 
stockholders’ interests. If they don’t, they may end up in jail like Tyco’s Dennis 
Kozlowski and Hollinger’s Conrad Black.
Boards of Directors The board of directors appoints top managers, including the 
CEO and CFO, and must approve important financial decisions. For example, only 
the board has legal authority to approve a dividend or a public issue of securities. The 
board approves compensation schemes and awards to top management. Boards usually 
delegate decision making for small and medium-size investments, but the authority to 
approve large investments is almost never delegated.
The board of directors is elected by shareholders and is supposed to represent their 
interests. Boards have been portrayed as passive supporters of top management, but 
the balance has tipped toward independence. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) 
requires that more directors be independent—that is, not affiliated with management. 
The majority of directors are now independent. Boards must also meet in executive 
sessions with the CEO not present. SOX also requires CEOs and CFOs to sign off 
personally on the corporation’s accounting procedures and results.
Activist Shareholders Institutional shareholders, including pension funds, have 
become more active in monitoring management and pushing for changes. CEOs have 
been forced out as a result, including the CEOs of JCPenney, Procter & Gamble, Barnes 
& Noble, Citigroup, Yahoo!, and Carnival. Boards outside the United States, which 
have traditionally been more management-friendly, have also become more willing to 
replace underperformers. The list of foreign companies with CEO departures includes 
Barclays, Carrefour, Siemens, Barrick, and Rio Tinto.
Although U.S. corporations typically have thousands of individual shareholders, 
they often also have blockholders, that is, investors who own 5%, 10%, or more of 
outstanding shares. The blockholders may include wealthy individuals or families—
for example, descendants of a founder. They may also include other corporations, 
pension funds, or foundations.9
 When a 5% blockholder calls, the CFO answers.
corporate governance
The laws, regulations, 
institutions, and corporate 
practices that protect 
shareholders and other 
investors.
