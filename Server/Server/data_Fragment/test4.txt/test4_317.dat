 to oversee the auditing of 
public companies; it banned accounting firms from offering other services to companies whose accounts they audit; it prohibited any individual from heading a firm’s

required that management certify that the financial statements present a fair view of 
the firm’s financial position and demonstrate that the firm has adequate controls and 
procedures for financial reporting. All this has come at a price. Managers and investors worry that the costs of SOX and the burden of meeting detailed, inflexible regulations are pushing some corporations to return from public to private ownership. 
Some blame SOX and onerous regulation in the United States for the fact that an 
increasing number of foreign companies have chosen to list their shares in London 
rather than New York.
There is also a vigorous debate over “rules-based” versus “principles-based” 
approaches to accounting standards. The United States follows a rules-based approach, 
companies must be ready to defend their accounting practices in light of the general principles laid out in the IFRS. 
By contrast, in the United States, GAAP are accompanied by 
thousands of pages of prescriptive regulatory guidance 
and interpretations from auditors and accounting groups. 
For example, more than 160 pieces of authoritative literature 
relate to how and when companies record revenue. This 
leaves less room for judgment, but detailed rules rapidly 
become out of date, and unscrupulous companies have been 
able to structure transactions so that they keep to the letter 
but not the spirit of the rules.
By 2014, it had become clear that the SEC’s plan to move 
to IFRS was effectively dead and that, while the SEC and IASB 
would co
