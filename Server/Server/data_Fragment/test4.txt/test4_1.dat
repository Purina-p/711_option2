ndex. These risks are averaged out by diversification. Of course you are still left with the risk that the level of the stock market as a 
whole will fall. In fact, we will see in Chapter 11 that investors are mostly concerned 
with market risk, not the specific risks of individual companies.
Index mutual funds are one way to invest in widely diversified portfolios at low 
cost. Another route is provided by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are portfolios 
of stocks that can be bought or sold in a single trade. For example, Standard & Poor’s 
Depositary Receipts (SPDRs, or “spiders”) invest in portfolios that match Standard & 
Poor’s stock market indexes. The total amount invested in the spider that tracks the 
benchmark S&P 500 index was $134 billion in early 2016.
ETFs are in some ways more efficient than mutual funds. To buy or sell an ETF, 
you simply make a trade, just as if you bought or sold shares of stock.14  This is 
13 Unfortunately for insurance companies, the losses don’t always average out. Hurricanes and earthquakes can 
damage thousands of homes at once. The potential losses are so great that property insurance companies buy 
reinsurance against such catastrophes.
14 ETFs are in this respect like closed-end mutual funds (see footnote 3). But ETFs do not have managers with 
the discretion to try to “pick winners.” ETF portfolios are tied down to indexes or fixed baskets of securities. 
ETF issuers make sure that the ETF price tracks the price of the underlying index or basket.

different from investing in an open-end mutual fund. In that case you have to send 
money to the fund in exchange for newly issued shares. And, if you want to withdraw 
the investment, you have to notify the fund, which redeems your shares and sends you 
a check. Also, many of the larger ETFs charge lower fees than mutual funds. State 
Street Global Advisors charges just .11% a year for managing the Standard & Poor’s 
500 Index Spider. For a $100,000 investment, the fee is only .0011 × 100,000 = $110.
Financial markets provide other mechanisms for sharing risks. For example, a 
wheat farmer and a baking company are each exposed to fluctuations in the price of 
wheat after the harvest. The farmer worries about low prices, the baker about high 
prices. They can both rest easier if the baker can agree with the farmer to buy wheat in 
the future at a fixed price. Of course, it would be difficult, to say the least, if the baker 
and the farmer had to contact an Internet dating service to get together to make a deal. 
Fortunately, no dating service is needed: Each can trade in commodity markets, the 
farmer as a seller and the baker as a buyer.
Liquidity
Markets and intermediaries also provide liquidity, that is, the ability to turn an investment back into cash when needed. Suppose you deposit $5,000 in a savings bank on 
February 1. During that month, the bank uses your deposit and other new deposits to 
make a 6-month construction loan to a real estate developer. On March 1, you realize 
that you need your $5,000 back. The bank can give it to you. Because the bank has 
thousands of depositors, and other sources of financing if necessary, it can make an 
illiquid loan to the developer financed by liquid deposits made by you and other customers. If you lend your money for 6 months directly to the real estate developer, you 
will have a hard time retrieving it 1 month later.15
The shares of public companies are liquid because they are traded more or less continuously in the stock market. An Italian investor who puts $60,000 into Bank of 
America shares can recover that money on short notice. (A $60,000 sell order is a drop 
in the bucket compared with the normal trading volume of Bank of America shares.) 
Mutual funds can redeem their shares for cash on short notice because the funds invest 
in traded securities, which can be sold as necessary.
Of course, liquidity is a matter of degree. Foreign exchange markets for major currencies are exceptionally liquid. Bank of America or Deutsche Bank could buy $200 million 
worth of yen or euros in the blink of an eye, with hardly any effect on foreign exchange 
rates. U.S. Treasury securities are also very liquid, and the shares of the largest companies on the major international stock exchanges are only slightly less so.
Liquidity is most important when you’re in a hurry. If you try to sell $500,000 
worth of the shares of a small, thinly traded company all at once, you will probably 
knock down the price to some extent. If you’re patient and don’t surprise other investors with a large, sudden sell order, you may be able to unload your shares on better 
terms. It’s the same problem that you may face in selling real estate. A house or condominium is not a liquid asset in a panic sale. If you’re determined to sell in an afternoon, you’re not going to get full value.
The Payment Mechanism
