 Home Depot’s published statement of cash flows differs from the cash-flow statement that we derived from 
the balance sheet and income statement. This is a common occurrence, particularly if the company has engaged

Free Cash Flow
The value of a company depends on how much cash it can generate for investors after 
it has paid for any new capital investments. This cash is called the company’s

2014. We start with the earnings produced by the firm’s ongoing operations. This is equal to 
Net income + debt interest = $6,345 + $830 = $7,175 million

that do not involve cash coming in or going out. First, we must add back depreciation 
because depreciation is not a cash outflow, even though it is treated as an expense in the 
income statement. Second, accounting income is not cash in the bank. For example, the firm 
may need to lay out money to buy materials ahead of time, or its customers may not pay for 
their purchases immediately. Therefore, to measure the cash from ongoing operations, we 
need to subtract those additions to net working capital shown in the top panel of the statement of cash flows. This gives us cash
