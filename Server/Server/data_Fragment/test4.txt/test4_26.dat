me blame SOX and onerous regulation in the United States for the fact that an 
increasing number of foreign companies have chosen to list their shares in London 
rather than New York.
There is also a vigorous debate over “rules-based” versus “principles-based” 
approaches to accounting standards. The United States follows a rules-based approach, 
companies must be ready to defend their accounting practices in light of the general principles laid out in the IFRS. 
By contrast, in the United States, GAAP are accompanied by

By 2014, it had become clear that the SEC’s plan to move 
to IFRS was effectively dead and that, while the SEC and IASB 
would continue to collaborate on accounting rules, there was 
little prospect of any agreement over a single global standard 
that included the United States.
The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which

For some years, the SEC has worked to bring U.S. accounting st
