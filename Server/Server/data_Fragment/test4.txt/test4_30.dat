5, you would pay 15 cents of 
tax on each extra dollar of income up to an income of $37,650. If your total income is 
$50,000, your tax bill is 10% of the first $9,275 of income, 15% of the next $28,375 
(i.e., 37,650 − 9,275), and 25% of the remaining $12,350:
Tax = (.10 × $9,275) + (.15 × $28,375) + (.25 × $12,350) = $8,271.25
marginal tax rate
Additional taxes owed per 
dollar of additional income.
Recalculate the figures in Table 3.6, assuming that firm A now has to make interest payments of $60 million. What happens to taxes paid? Does net income fall 
by the additional $20 million interest payment compared with the case considered in Table 3.6, where interest expense was only $40 million?

The average tax rate is simply the total tax bill divided by total income. In this 
example it is $8,271.25/$50,000 = .165, or 16.5%. Notice that the average rate is lower 
than the marginal rate. This is because of the lower rates on the first $37,650.

Average and

The tax rates in Table 3.7 apply to “ordinary income,” primarily income earned as 
salary or wages. Interest earnings also are treated as ordinary income.
The U.S. government also taxes investment earnings, for example dividends or 
capital gains. The treatment of dividend income in the United States leads to what is 
commonly dubbed the “double taxation” of corporate earnings. Each dollar the company earns is taxed at the corporate rate. Then, if the company pays a dividend out of 
this after-tax income, the shareholder pays personal income taxes on the distribution. 
The original earnings are taxed first as corporate income and again as dividend income. 
Suppose instead that the company earns a dollar which is paid out as interest. The dollar escapes corporate tax because the interest payment is considered a business expense 
that reduces the firm’s taxable income.
Capital gains are also taxed, but only when the gains are realized. Suppose that you 
bought Bio-technics stock when it was selling for 10 cents a share. Its market price 
today is $1 a share. As long as you hold on to your stock, there is no tax to pay on your 
gain. But if you sell, the 90 cents of capital gain is taxed. 
Table 3.8 shows tax rates on investment income. For most investors, the effective 
tax rate is either 15% or 18.8% (15% plus a potential 3.8% surcharge), but the highest 
income investors pay an effective rate of 23.8%.
Financial managers need to worry about the tax treatment of investment income 
because tax policy will affect the prices individuals are willing to pay for the company’s stock or bonds. We will return to these issues in Part 5 of the text.
The tax rates in Table 3.7 and Table 3.8 apply to individuals. But financial institutions are major investors in corporate securities. These institutions often have special 
tax provisions. For example, pension funds are not taxed on interest or dividend 
income or on capital gains.
*These rates apply to capital gains and dividends on assets held for at least one year.
**In addition to these nominal rates, an additional 3.8% surtax is assessed on net investment income for taxpayers 
with total income over $200,000 (single filers) or $250,000 (married filing jointly).
What are the average and marginal tax rates for a single taxpayer with a taxable 
income of $80,000? What are the average and marginal tax rates for married 
taxpayers filing joint returns if their joint taxable income is also $80,000?

76 Part One Introduction
bre22619_ch03_056-085.indd 76 10/07/16 03:18 PM
SUMMARY
Investors and other stakeholders in the firm need regular financial information to help 
them monitor the firm’s progress. Accountants summarize this information in a balance 
sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows.
The balance sheet provides a snapshot of the firm’s assets and liabilities. The assets 
consist of current assets that can be rapidly turned into cash and fixed assets such as plant 
and machinery. The liabilities consist of current liabilities that are due for payment within 
a year and long-term debts. The difference between the assets and the liabilities represents 
the amount of the shareholders’ equity.
The income statement measures the profitability of the company during the year. 
It shows the difference between revenues and expenses.
The statement of cash flows measures the sources and uses of cash during the year. 
The change in the company’s cash balance is the difference between sources and uses.
It is important to distinguish between the book values that are shown in the company 
accounts and the market values of the assets and liabilities. Book values are historical 
measures based on the original cost of an asset. For example, the assets in the balance sheet 
are shown at their historical cost less an allowance for depreciation. Similarly, the figure 
for shareholders’ equity measures the cash that shareholders have contributed in the past or 
that the company has reinvested on their behalf. In contrast, market value is the current 
price of an asset or liability.
Income is not the same as cash flow. There are two reasons for this: (1) Investment in fixed 
assets is not deducted immediately from income but is instead spread (as charges for depreciation) over the expected life of the equipment, and (2) the accountant records revenues 
when the sale is made, rather than when the customer actually pays the bill, and at the same 
time deducts the production costs even though those costs may have been incurred earlier.
For large companies the marginal rate of tax on income is 35%. In calculating taxable 
income the company deducts an allowance for depreciation and interest payments. It cannot deduct dividend payments to the shareholders.
Individuals are also taxed on their income, which includes dividends and interest on 
their investments. Capital gains are taxed, but only when the investment is sold and the 
gain realized.
What information is 
contained in the balance 
sheet, income statement, 
and statement of cash 
flows? (LO3-1)
What is the difference 
between market and book 
values? (LO3-2) 
Why does accounting 
income differ from cash 
flow? (LO3-3)
What are the essential 
features of the taxation of 
corporate and personal 
income? (LO3-4)
LISTING OF EQUATION
3.1 Shareholders’ equity = net assets = total assets − total liabilities
QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
1. Financial Statements. Earlier in the chapter, we characterized the balance sheet as providing a 
snapshot of the firm at one point in time and the income statement as providing a video. What 
did we mean by this? Is the statement of cash flow more like a snapshot or a video? (LO3-1)
2. Balance Sheet. Balance sheet items are usually entered in order of declining liquidity. Place 
each of the terms below in the appropriate place in the following balance sheet. (LO3-1)
Accounts payable Total current assets
Net fixed assets Accounts receivable
Debt due for repayment Total current liabilities
Cash and marketable securities Inventories
Equity Long-term debt
