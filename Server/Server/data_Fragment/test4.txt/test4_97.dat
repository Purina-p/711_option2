Oracle, Ellison owns shares worth $49 billion. No one can say for certain 
how hard Ellison would have worked with a different compensation package, but one 
thing is clear: He has a huge personal stake in Oracle’s market value.
Well-designed compensation schemes alleviate agency problems by encouraging 
managers to maximize shareholder wealth. But some schemes are not well designed; 
they reward managers even when value is destroyed. For example, during Robert 
Nardelli’s 6-year tenure as CEO, Home Depot’s stock price fell by 20% while shares of 
its rival Lowe’s nearly doubled. When Nardelli was ousted in January 2007, he received 
a farewell package worth $210 million. Needless to say, many shareholders were livid.
In 2010, the Dodd-Frank financial reform law gave U.S. shareholders the right to 
express their opinion on executive compensation through nonbinding “say on pay” 
votes at 1- or 3-year intervals. (Shareholders of U.K. companies have a similar right.) 
What are agency problems and agency costs? Give two or three examples of 
decisions by managers that can lead to agency costs.
