The financial crisis had its roots in the easy-money policies that were pursued by 
the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks following the collapse of the Internet 
and telecom stock bubble in 2000. At the same time, large balance-of-payments surpluses in Asian economies were invested back into U.S. debt securities. This also 
helped to push down interest rates and contribute to lax credit.
Banks took advantage of this cheap money to expand the supply of subprime mortgages to low-income borrowers. Many banks tempted would-be homeowners with low

were betting on escalating housing prices so that they could resell or refinance before 
the higher payments kicked in.) One lender is even said to have advertised what it 
dubbed its “NINJA” loan—NINJA standing for “No Income, No Job, and No Assets.” 
Most subprime mortgages were then packaged together into mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) that could be resold. But, instead of selling these securities to investors
