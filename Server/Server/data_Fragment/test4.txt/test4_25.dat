Chapter 3 Accounting and Finance 71

investors. Investors worry about the fact that some companies seem particularly prone 
to inflate their earnings by playing fast and loose with accounting practice. They refer 
to such companies as having “low-quality” earnings, and they place a correspondingly 
lower value on the firms’ stock.
Here are some examples of ambiguities in accounting rules that have been used by 
companies to conceal unflattering information:
∙ Revenue recognition. As we saw earlier, firms record a sale when it is made, not 
when the customer actually pays. But the date of sale is not always obvious. 
Suppose it is November and you are concerned that if your firm does not meet its 
sales target, you can forget about your annual bonus. You contact your main 
customers, and they agree to increase their December orders as long as they have 
the right to return any unsold goods. Your firm then books these shipments as 
“sales,” even though there is a high likelihood that many of the goods will be 
returned. That is almost certainly illegal and will get you into serious trouble. 
But suppose instead that you tell your customers that the price of your product 
may rise in the new year and suggest that they place an extra order in December. 
This practice, known as “channel stuffing,” increases this year’s sales at the 
expense of next year’s sales.
 Many companies have been thought to use channel stuffing to overstate their 
earnings, but very blatant instances are liable to attract the SEC’s attention. 
For example, in 2002 the pharmaceutical giant, Bristol Myers Squibb, disclosed 
that wholesalers were holding hundreds of millions of dollars in excessive 
inventories of its products and the company’s earnings for 2002 might be just half 
of its 2001 earnings as wholesalers worked down these inventories. Following an 
investigation by the SEC, the company agreed to pay $150 million to settle 
accusations that this channel stuffing had improperly inflated its sales and earnings. 
In Chapter 1, we mentioned Hewlett-Packard’s disastrous acquisition of the British 
company Autonomy. Hewlett-Packard paid $11.1 billion for Autonomy. Just over a 
year later, it wrote down the value of the company by $8.8 billion, alleging that 
Autonomy had used channel stuffing to greatly inflate its revenues.
∙ Cookie-jar reserves. The giant mortgage-pass-through firm Freddie Mac earned the 
Wall Street nickname “Steady Freddie” for its unusually smooth and predictable 
pattern of earnings growth, at least until 2008 when it suddenly collapsed in the 
wake of the meltdown in subprime mortgages. Unfortunately, it emerged in 2003 
that Freddie achieved this predictability in part by misusing its reserve accounts. 
Normally, such accounts are intended to allow for the likely impact of events 
that might reduce earnings, such as the failure of customers to pay their bills. 
But Freddie seemed to “overreserve” against such contingencies so that it could 
“release” those reserves and bolster income in a bad year. Its steady growth was 
largely a matter of earnings management.
∙ Off–balance sheet assets and liabilities. Before its bankruptcy in 2001 (at that time, 
the second largest in U.S. history), Enron had accumulated large debts and had also 
guaranteed the debts of other companies in which it had an ownership stake. 
To present a fair view of the firm, Enron should have recognized these potential 
liabilities on its balance sheet. But the firm created and placed paper firms—
so-called special-purpose entities (SPEs)—in the middle of its transactions and 
excluded these liabilities from its financial statements.
The collapse of Enron illustrates how dishonest managers with creamy compensation packages may be tempted to conceal the truth from investors. If the company had 
been more transparent to outsiders—that is, if they could have assessed its true profitability and prospects—its problems would have shown up right away in a falling stock 
price. This in turn would have generated extra scrutiny from security analysts, bond 
rating agencies, lenders, and investors.

With transparency, corporate troubles generally lead to corrective action. But the 
top management of a troubled and opaque company may be able to maintain its stock 
price and postpone the discipline of the market. Market discipline caught up with 
Enron only a month or two before bankruptcy.
Enron was not the only company to be mired in accounting scandals in the early 
years of the century. Firms such as Global Crossing, Qwest Communications, and 
WorldCom misstated profits by billions of dollars. Overseas, the Italian dairy company Parmalat falsified the existence of a bank account to the tune of $5.5 billion, and 
the French media and entertainment company Vivendi came close to bankruptcy after 
it was accused of accounting fraud. In response to these scandals, Congress passed the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, widely known as SOX. A major goal of SOX is to increase transparency and ensure that companies and their accountants provide directors, lenders, 
and shareholders with the information they need to monitor progress.
SOX created the Public Accounting Oversight Board to oversee the auditing of 
public companies; it banned accounting firms from offering other services to companies whose accounts they audit; it prohibited any individual from heading a firm’s 
audit for more than 5 years; and it required that the board’s audit committee consist of 
directors who are independent of the company’s management. Sarbanes-Oxley also 
required that management certify that the financial statements present a fair view of 
the firm’s financial position and demonstrate that the firm has adequate controls and 
procedures for financial reporting. All this has come at a price. Managers and investors worry that the costs of SOX and the burden of meeting detailed, inflexible regulations are pushing some corporations to return from public to private ownership.
