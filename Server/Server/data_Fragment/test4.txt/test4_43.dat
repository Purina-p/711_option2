 new hubs across the United 
States as well as in Canada, France, the Philippines, and China. In 2007, FedEx (as the 
company was now called) became the world’s largest airline measured by number of 
planes. FedEx also invested in other companies, capped by the acquisition of Kinko’s 
for $2.4 billion in 2004. By 2016, FedEx had 325,000 employees, annual revenue of 
$49 billion, and a stock market value of almost $40 billion. Its name had become a 
verb—to “FedEx a package” was to ship it overnight.
Even in retrospect, FedEx’s success was hardly a sure thing. Fred Smith’s idea was 
inspired, but its implementation was complex and difficult. FedEx had to make good 
investment decisions. In the beginning, these decisions were constrained by lack of 
financing. For example, used Falcon jets were the only option, given the young company’s precarious financial position. At first it could service only a short list of the 
major cities. As the company grew, its investment decisions became more complex. 
Which type of planes should it buy? When should it expand coverage to Europe and

 Legend has it that Smith received a grade of C on this paper. In fact, he doesn’t remember the grade.

Asia? How many operations hubs should it build? What computer and tracking systems were necessary to keep up with the increasing package volume and geographic 
coverage? Which companies should it acquire as it expanded its range of services?
FedEx also needed to make good financing decisions. For example, how should it 
raise the money it needed for investment? In the beginning, these choices were limited 
to family money and bank loans. As the company grew, its range of choices expanded. 
Eventually it was able to attract funding from venture capitalists, but this posed new 
questions. How much cash did the firm need to raise from the venture capitalists? How 
big a share in the firm would the venture capitalists demand in return? The initial public 
offering of stock prompted similar questions. How many shares should the company try 
to sell? At what price? As the company grew, it raised more funds by borrowing money 
from its banks and by selling publicly traded bonds to investors. At each point, it needed 
to decide on the proper form and terms of financing as well as the amounts to be raised.
In short, FedEx needed to be good at finance. It had a head start over potential 
competitors, but a series of bad financial decisions would have sunk the company. 
No two companies’ histories are the same, but, like FedEx, all successful companies 
must make good investment and financing decisions. And, as with FedEx, those 
decisions range from prosaic and obvious to difficult and strategically crucial.
Let’s widen our discussion. Table 1.1 gives an example of a recent investment and 
financing decision for 11 corporations. Seven are
