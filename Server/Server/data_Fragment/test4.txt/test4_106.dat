ities firms protect their reputations.
When something happens to undermine reputations, the costs can be enormous. 
Volkswagen (VW) is a recent case in point. VW had installed secret software that cut 
back pollution from its diesel cars, but only when the cars were tested. Actual pollution in regular driving was much higher—and far in excess of legal maximums. 
Discovery of the software scandal in 2015 caused a tidal wave of opprobrium. VW’s 
stock price dropped by 35%. Its CEO was fired. VW diesel vehicles piled up unsold on 
car dealers’ lots. Potential fines imposed by the U.S. and European governments could 
be enormous. VW set aside $7.3 billion to cover costs and losses, but some analysts 
viewed this amount as much too low.
Charlatans and swindlers sometimes prey on individual investors, especially in 
booming markets. (It’s only “when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been 
swimming naked.”12) The tide went out in 2008 and a number of frauds were exposed. 
One notorious example was the Ponzi scheme run by the disgraced financier Bernard 
Madoff (pronounced “Made-off ”).13 Individuals and institutions invested around 
$20 billion with Madoff and were told that their investments had grown to $65 billion. 
That figure turned out to be completely fictitious. (It’s not clear what Madoff did with 
all this money, but much of it was apparently paid out to early investors in the scheme to 
create an impression of superior investment performance.) With hindsight, the investors 
should not have trusted Madoff or the financial advisers who steered money to him.
Madoff’s Ponzi scheme was (we hope) a once-in-a-lifetime event. (Ponzi schemes 
pop up frequently, but few have approached the scope and duration of Madoff’s.) 
It was astonishingly unethical and illegal and was bound to end in tears. Needless to 
say, it was not designed to add value for investors.

The Great Albanian 
Ponzi Scheme
12 The quotation is from Warren Buffett’s annual letter to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, March 2008.
13 Ponzi schemes are named after Charles Ponzi, who founded an investment company in 1920 that promised 
investors unbelievably high returns. He was soon deluged with funds from investors in New England, taking in 
$1 million during one 3-hour period. Ponzi invested only about $30 of the money that he raised. But he used part of 
the cash provided by later investors to pay generous dividends to the original investors, thus promoting the illusion 
of high profits and quick payoffs. Within months the scheme collapsed and Ponzi started a 5-year prison sentence.
