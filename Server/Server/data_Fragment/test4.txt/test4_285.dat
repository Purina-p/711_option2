 But this often bears little resemblance to the total market value that investors place on the shares.
If the market price of the firm’s shares falls through the floor, don’t try telling the 
shareholders that the book value is satisfactory—they won’t want to hear. Shareholders are concerned with the market value of their shares; market value, not book value, 
is the price at which they can sell their shares. Managers who wish to keep their shareholders happy will focus on market values.
We will often find it useful to think about the firm in terms of a market-value 
balance sheet. Like a conventional balance sheet, a market-value balance sheet lists 
the firm’s assets, but it records each asset at its current market value rather than at 
historical cost less depreciation. Similarly, each liability is shown at its market value. 
The difference between the market values of assets and liabilities is the market 
value of the shareholders’ equity claim. The stock price is simply the market 
value of shareholders’ equity divided by the number of outstanding shares.
