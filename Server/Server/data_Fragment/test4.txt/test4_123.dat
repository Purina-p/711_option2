 also by evening courses at a local college. Last year I 
was promoted to branch manager. I oversee the branch’s 
operations and help customers with a wide variety of problems. I’m also spending more time on credit analysis of 
business loan applications. I want to expand the branch’s 
business customers, but not by making loans to shaky 
companies.
Susan Webb, Research Analyst, Mutual Fund Group
After majoring in biochemistry, I joined the research department of a large mutual fund group. Because of my background, I was assigned to work with the senior pharmaceuticals 
analyst. I start the day by reading The Wall Street Journal and 
reviewing the analyses that come in each day from stockbroking firms. Sometimes we need to revise our earnings 
forecasts and meet with the portfolio managers to discuss 
possible trades. The remainder of my day is spent mainly in 
analyzing companies and developing forecasts of revenues 
and earnings. I meet frequently with pharmaceutical analysts 
in stockbroking firms, and we regularly visit company management. In the evenings I study for the Chartered Financial 
Analyst (CFA) exam. I did not study finance at college, so this

research role to become a portfolio manager.
