The accountant also does not ignore the fact that the firm has to wait until period 3 
to collect its bills. When the sale is made in period 2, the figure for accounts receivable 
in the balance sheet is increased to show that the company’s customers owe an extra 
$100 in unpaid bills. Later, when the customers pay those bills in period 3, accounts 
receivable are reduced by $100. Therefore, to go from the sales shown in the income 
statement to the cash inflows, we need to subtract the investment in receivables:
Period: 2 3
 Sales (income statement) 100 0
− Investment in receivables (balance sheet) 100 −100
= Cash received 0 +100
We will return to these issues in more detail in Chapter 9, but for now we summarize the key points as follows: Cash outflow is equal to the cost of goods sold, which is 
shown in the income statement, plus the change in inventories. Cash inflow is equal to 
the sales shown in the income statement less the change in uncollected bills.
Profits versus Cash Flows
Suppose our manufacturer spends a further $80 to produce goods in period 2. It sells these 
goods in period 3 for $120, but customers do not pay their bills until period 4.
The cash flows from these transactions are now
