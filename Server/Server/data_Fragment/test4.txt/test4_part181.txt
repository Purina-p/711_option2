There are about 8,000 mutual funds in the United States. In fact, there are more mutual 
funds than public companies! The funds pursue a wide variety of investment strategies. 
Some funds specialize in safe stocks with generous dividend payouts. Some specialize in 
high-tech growth stocks. Some “balanced” funds offer mixtures of stocks and bonds. 
Some specialize in particular countries or regions. For example, the Fidelity Investments 
mutual fund group sponsors funds for Canada, Japan, China, Europe, and Latin America.
