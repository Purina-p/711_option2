y the value to the bank of your promise. But now suppose that $1 million is not 
due to be repaid for several years. The accounts still show a liability of $1 million, but 
how much your debt is worth depends on what happens to interest rates. If interest 
rates rise after you have issued the debt, lenders may not be prepared to pay as much 
as $1 million for your debt; if interest rates fall, they may be prepared to pay more than 
$1 million.4
 Thus the market value of a long-term liability may be higher or lower 
than the book value. Market values of assets and liabilities do not generally equal 
their book values. Book values are based on historical or original values. Market 
values measure current values of assets and liabilities.
The difference between book value and market value is likely to be greatest for 
shareholdersâ€™ equity. The book value of equity measures the cash that shareholders 
have contributed in the past plus the cash that the company has retained and reinvested 
in the business on their behalf.
