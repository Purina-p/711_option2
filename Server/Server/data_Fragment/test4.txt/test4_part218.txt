ke both the firm and its shareholders better off financially. Projects offering 
rates of return less than the cost of capital subtract value and should not be 
undertaken.17
Thus the hurdle rate for investments inside the corporation is actually set outside 
the corporation. The expected rate of return on investments in financial markets determines the opportunity cost of capital.
The opportunity cost of capital is generally not the interest rate that the firm pays on 
a loan from a bank or insurance company. If the company is making a risky investment, the opportunity cost of capital is the expected rate of return that investors can 
achieve in financial markets at the same level of risk. The expected rate of return on 
risky securities is normally well above the interest rate on corporate borrowing.
We introduced the cost of capital in Chapter 1, but this brief reminder may help to 
fix the idea. We cover the cost of capital in detail in Chapters 11 and 12.
