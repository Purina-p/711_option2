 legal entity. Suppose you decide to create a 
new corporation.3
 You would work with a lawyer to prepare articles of incorporation,
which set out the purpose of the business and how it is to be financed, managed, and 
governed. These articles must conform to the laws of the state in which the business is 
incorporated. For many purposes, the corporation is considered a resident of its state. 
For example, it can enter into contracts, borrow or lend money, and sue or be sued. 
It pays its own taxes (but it cannot vote!).
A corporation’s owners are called shareholders or stockholders.4
 The shareholders 
do not directly own the business’s real assets (factories, oil wells, stores, etc.). Instead 
they have indirect ownership via financial assets (the shares of the corporation).
A corporation is legally distinct from the shareholders. Therefore, the shareholders 
have limited liability and cannot be held personally responsible for the corporation’s 
debts. When the U.S. financial corporation Lehman Brothers failed in 2008, no one 
demanded that its stockholders put up more money to cover Lehman’s massive debts. 
Shareholders can lose their entire investment in a corporation, but no more.
