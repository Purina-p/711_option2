 revenues shown in the income statement and the cash inflow:
In the income statement the accountant records sales of $100 in period 1 and $120 in 
period 2. The fact that the firm has to wait for payment is recognized in the balance sheet as 
an investment in receivables. The cash that the company receives is equal to the sales 
shown in the income statement less the investment in receivables. ■
Consider a firm that spends $200 to produce goods in period 1. In period 2, 
it sells half of those goods for $150, but it doesn’t collect payment until one 
period later. In period 3, it sells the other half of the goods for $150, and it 
collects payment on these sales in period 4. Calculate the profits and the cash 
flows for this firm in periods 1 to 4.
