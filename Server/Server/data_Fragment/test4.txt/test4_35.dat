depreciation on fixed assets is $17,633 million. So while the assets cost $40,353 
million, their net value in the accounts is only $40,353 − $17,633 = $22,720 million.
In addition to its tangible assets, Home Depot also has valuable intangible assets, 
such as its brand name, skilled management, and a well-trained labor force. Accountants are generally reluctant to record these intangible assets in the balance sheet unless 
they can be readily identified and valued.
There is, however, one important exception. When Home Depot has acquired other 
businesses in the past, it has paid more for their assets than the value shown in the 
firms’ accounts. This difference is shown in Home Depot’s balance sheet as “goodwill.” 
Most of the intangible assets on Home Depot’s balance sheet consist of goodwill.
Now look at the right-hand portion of Home Depot’s balance sheet, which shows 
where the money to buy its assets came from. The accountant starts by looking at the 
company’s liabilities—that is, the money owed by the company. First come those liabilities that are likely to be paid off most rapidly. For example, Home Depot has borrowed 
$328 million, due to be repaid shortly. It also owes its suppliers $9,473 million for goods 
that have been delivered but not yet paid for. These unpaid bills are shown as accounts 
payable (or payables). Both the borrowings and the payables are debts that Home Depot 
must repay within the year. They are therefore classified as current liabilities.
Home Depot’s current assets total $15,302 million; its current liabilities amount to 
$11,269 million. Therefore, the difference between the value of Home Depot’s current 
assets and its current liabilities is $15,302 − $11,269 = $4,033 million. This figure is 
known as Home Depot’s net current assets or net working capital. It roughly measures 
the company’s potential reservoir of cash.
Below the current liabilities Home Depot’s accountants have listed the firm’s longterm liabilities, such as debts that come due after the end of a year. You can see that banks 
and other investors have made long-term loans to Home Depot of $16,869 million.
Home Depot’s liabilities are financial obligations to various parties. For example, 
when Home Depot buys goods from its suppliers, it has a liability to pay for them; 
when it borrows from the bank, it has a liability to repay the loan. Thus the suppliers 
and the bank have first claim on the firm’s assets. What is left over after the liabilities

have been paid off belongs to the shareholders. This figure is known as the shareholders’ equity. For Home Depot the total value of shareholders’ equity amounts to $9,322 
million. Table 3.1 shows that Home Depot’s equity is made up of three parts. One portion, $8,521 million, has resulted from the occasional sale of new shares to investors. 
A much larger amount, $26,995 million, has come from earnings that Home Depot has 
retained and reinvested in the business on the shareholders’ behalf.3
 Finally, treasury 
stock is a large negative number, −$26,194 million. This represents the amount that 
Home Depot has spent on buying back its shares. The money to repurchase them has 
gone out of the firm and reduced shareholders’ equity.
Figure 3.1 shows how the separate items in the balance sheet link together. There 
are two classes of assets—current assets, which will soon be used or turned into cash, 
and long-term or “fixed” assets, which may be either tangible or intangible. There are 
also two classes of liability—current liabilities, which are due for payment shortly, and 
long-term liabilities.
The difference between the assets and the liabilities represents the amount of the 
shareholders’ equity. This is the basic balance sheet identity. Shareholders are sometimes called “residual claimants” on the firm. We mean by this that shareholders’ 
equity is what is left over when the liabilities of the firm are subtracted from its assets:
 Shareholders’ equity = net assets = total assets − total liabilities (3.1)
3
 Here is an occasional source of confusion. You may be tempted to think of retained earnings as a pile of cash that 
the company has built up from its past operations. But there is absolutely no link between retained earnings and 
cash balances. The earnings that Home Depot has plowed back into the business may have been used to buy new 
equipment, trucks, warehouses, and so on. Typically only a small proportion will be kept in the bank. Notice that 
Home Depot’s balance sheet lists $26,995 in retained earnings but only $1,723 in cash and marketable securities.

When comparing financial statements, analysts often calculate a common-size 
balance sheet, which re-expresses all items as a percentage of total assets. Table 3.2 is 
Home Depot’s common-size balance sheet. The financial manager might look at this 
common-size balance sheet and notice right away that in 2014 receivables accounted 
for a higher proportion of the firm’s assets than they did in the previous year. There 
may be good reasons for this, but the manager might wish to check that the company 
has not become lazy in collecting its customers’ unpaid bills.

bonds. It places $100 million of the proceeds in the bank and uses $400 million 
to buy new machinery. What items of the balance sheet would change? Would 
shareholders’ equity change?

By the way, it is easy to obtain the financial statements of almost any publicly 
traded firm. Most firms make their annual reports available on the web. You also can 
find key financial statements of most firms at Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com) or 
Google Finance (finance.google.com).
Book Values and Market Values
Throughout this book, we will frequently make a distinction between the book values 
of the assets shown in the balance sheet and their market values.
Items in the balance sheet are valued according to generally accepted accounting 
principles, commonly called GAAP. These state that assets must be shown in the balance sheet at their historical cost adjusted for depreciation. Book values are therefore 
“backward-looking” measures of value. They are based on the past cost of the asset, 
not its current market price or value to the firm. For example, suppose that 2 years 
ago Home Depot built an office building for $30 million and that in today’s market 
the building would sell for $40 million. The book value of the building would be less 
than its market value, and the balance sheet would understate the value of Home 
Depot’s asset.
Or consider a specialized plant that Intel develops for producing special-purpose 
computer chips at a cost of $800 million. The book value of the plant is $800 million 
less accumulated depreciation. But suppose that shortly after the plant is constructed, 
a new chip makes the existing one obsolete. The market value of Intel’s new plant 
could fall by 50% or more. In this case, market value would be less than book value.
The difference between book value and market value is greater for some assets than 
for others. It is zero in the case of cash but potentially very large for fixed assets where 
the accountant starts with initial cost and then depreciates that figure according to a 
prespecified schedule. The purpose of depreciation is to allocate the original cost of 
the asset over its life, and the rules governing the depreciation of asset values do not 
reflect actual loss of market value. Usually the market value of fixed assets is much 
higher than the book value, but sometimes it is less.

62 Part One Introduction
bre22619_ch03_056-085.indd 62 10/07/16 03:18 PM
The same goes for the right-hand side of the balance sheet. In the case of liabilities, 
the accountant simply records the amount of money that you have promised to pay. 
For short-term liabilities, this figure is generally close to the market value of that 
promise. For example, if you owe the bank $1 million tomorrow, the accounts show a 
book liability of $1 million. As long as you are not bankrupt, that $1 million is also 
roughly the value to the bank of your promise. But now suppose that $1 million is not 
due to be repaid for several years. The accounts still show a liability of $1 million, but 
how much your debt is worth depends on what happens to interest rates. If interest 
rates rise after you have issued the debt, lenders may not be prepared to pay as much 
as $1 million for your debt; if interest rates fall, they may be prepared to pay more than 
$1 million.4
 Thus the market value of a long-term liability may be higher or lower 
than the book value. Market values of assets and liabilities do not generally equal 
their book values. Book values are based on historical or original values. Market 
values measure current values of assets and liabilities.
The difference between book value and market value is likely to be greatest for 
shareholders’ equity. The book value of equity measures the cash that shareholders 
have contributed in the past plus the cash that the company has retained and reinvested 
in the business on their behalf. But this often bears little resemblance to the total market value that investors place on the shares.
If the market price of the firm’s shares falls through the floor, don’t try telling the 
shareholders that the book value is satisfactory—they won’t want to hear. Shareholders are concerned with the market value of their shares; market value, not book value, 
is the price at which they can sell their shares. Managers who wish to keep their shareholders happy will focus on market values.
We will often find it useful to think about the firm in terms of a market-value 
balance sheet. Like a conventional balance sheet, a market-value balance sheet lists 
the firm’s assets, but it records each asset at its current market value rather than at 
historical cost less depreciation. Similarly, each liability is shown at its market value. 
The difference between the market values of assets and liabilities is the market 
value of the shareholders’ equity claim. The stock price is simply the market 
value of shareholders’ equity divided by the number of outstanding shares.

 We will show you how changing interest rates affect the market value of debt in Chapter 6.

Market- versus Book-Value Balance Sheets
Jupiter has developed a revolutionary auto production process that enables it to produce 
cars 20% more efficiently than any rival. It has invested $10 billion in building its new plant. 
To finance the investment, Jupiter borrowed $4 billion and raised the remaining funds by 
selling new shares of stock in the firm. There are currently 100 million shares of stock 
outstanding. Investors are very excited about Jupiter’s prospects. They believe that the flow 
of profits from the new plant justifies a stock price of $75.
If these are Jupiter’s only assets, the book-value balance sheet immediately after it has 
made the investment is as follows:

 Jupiter has borrowed $4 billion to finance its investment, but if the interest rate has changed in the meantime,

Shareholders’ equity 7.5
Investors are placing a market value on Jupiter’s equity of $7.5 billion ($75 per share 
times 100 million shares). We assume that the debt outstanding is worth $4 billion.5 Therefore, if you owned all Jupiter’s shares and all its debt, the value of your holdings would be 
$7.5 + $4 = $11.5 billion. In this case, you would own the company lock, stock, and barrel 
and would be entitled to all its cash flows. Because you can buy the entire company for 
$11.5 billion, the total value of Jupiter’s assets must also be $11.5 billion. In other words, the 
market value of the assets must be equal to the market value of the liabilities plus the market value of the shareholders’ equity.
We can now draw up the market-value balance sheet as follows:
Notice that the market value of Jupiter’s plant is $1.5 billion more than the plant cost to 
build. The difference is due to the superior profits that investors expect the plant to earn. 
Thus, in contrast to the balance sheet shown in the company’s books, the market-value 
balance sheet is forward-looking. It depends on the profits that investors expect the 
assets to provide. ■
Is it surprising that market value generally exceeds book value? It shouldn’t be. Firms 
find it attractive to raise money to invest in various projects because they believe the 
projects will be worth more than they cost. Otherwise, why bother? You will usually 
find that shares of stock sell for more than the value shown in the company’s books.
The Income Statement
If Home Depot’s balance sheet resembles a snapshot of the firm at a particular time, its 
income statement is like a video. It shows how profitable the firm has been during the 
past year.
Look at the summary income statement in Table 3.3. You can see that during fiscal 
2014, Home Depot sold goods worth $83,176 million and that the total cost of acquiring and selling those goods was $54,222 + $16,699 = $70,921 million. The largest 
expense item, amounting to $54,222 million, consisted of the cost of goods sold. This 
included the acquisition cost of Home Depot’s goods, the wages of its employees, and 
the other expenses incurred to obtain and sell its wares. Almost all the remaining

expenses were administrative expenses such as head office costs, advertising, and 
distribution.
In addition to these out-of-pocket expenses, Home Depot also made a deduction 
for the value of the plant and equipment used up in producing the goods. In 2014, 
this charge for depreciation was $1,786 million. Thus Home Depot’s earnings before 
interest and taxes (EBIT) were
EBIT = total revenues + other income − costs − depreciation
= 83, 176 + 337 − (54,222 + 16,699) − 1, 786 
= $10, 806 million
The remainder of the income statement shows where these earnings went. As we 
saw earlier, Home Depot has partly financed its investment in plant and equipment by 
borrowing. In 2014, it paid $830 million of interest on this borrowing. A further slice 
of the profit went to the government in the form of taxes. This amounted to $3,631 
million. The $6,345 million that was left over after paying interest and taxes belonged 
to the shareholders. Of this sum, Home Depot paid out $2,530 million in dividends 
and reinvested the remaining $3,815 million in the business. Presumably, these reinvested funds made the company more valuable.
The $3,815 of earnings that Home Depot retained and reinvested in the firm show 
up on its balance sheet as an increase in retained earnings. Notice that retained earnings in Table 3.1 increased by $3,815 million in 2014, from $23,180 million to $26,995 
million. However, shareholders’ equity fell during the year because Home Depot also 
repurchased some of its stock.
Just as it is sometimes useful to prepare a common-size balance sheet, we can also 
prepare a common-size income statement. In this case, all items are expressed as a 
percentage of revenues. The last column of Table 3.3 is Home Depot’s common-size 
income statement. You can see, for example, that the cost of goods sold consumed 
65.2% of revenues and that selling, general, and administrative expenses absorbed a 
further 20.1%.
Income versus Cash Flow
It is important to distinguish between Home Depot’s income and the cash that the 
company generated. Here are two reasons that income and cash are not the same:
1. Depreciation. When Home Depot’s accountants prepare the income statement, they 
do not simply count the cash coming in and the cash going out. Instead, the 
accountant starts with the cash payments but then divides these payments into two
