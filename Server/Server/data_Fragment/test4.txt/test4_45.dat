Take a look at the decisions now. We think you will agree that they appear 
sensible—at least there is nothing obviously wrong with them. But if you are new to 
finance, it may be difficult to think about why these companies made these decisions 
and not others.
The Investment (Capital Budgeting) Decision
Investment decisions, such as those shown in Table 1.1, are also called capital 
budgeting or capital expenditure (CAPEX) decisions. Some of the investments in 
the table, such as Walmart’s new stores or Virgin Atlantic’s new planes, involve 
tangible assets—assets that you can touch and kick. Others involve intangible assets, 
such as research and development (R&D), advertising, and the design of computer 
software. For example, major pharmaceutical manufacturers invest billions every year 
on R&D for new drugs.
Most of the investments in Table 1.1 have long-term consequences. For example, 
the planes acquired by Virgin Atlantic may still be flying 20 or 30 years from now. 
Other investments may pay off in only a few months. For example, with the approach 
of the Christmas holidays, Walmart spends nearly $50 billion to stock up its warehouses and retail stores. As the goods are sold over the following months, the company 
recovers its investment in these inventories.
