The financial manager regularly encounters other financial markets. Here are three 
examples, with references to the chapters where they are discussed:
∙ Foreign exchange markets (Chapter 22). Any corporation engaged in international 
trade must be able to transfer money back and forth between dollars and other 
currencies. Foreign exchange is traded over the counter through a network of the 
largest international banks.
∙ Commodities markets (Chapter 24). Dozens of commodities are traded on organized 
exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) or the Intercontinental 
Exchange. You can buy or sell corn, wheat, cotton, fuel oil, natural gas, copper, 
silver, platinum, and so on.
∙ Markets for options and other derivatives (Chapters 23 and 24). Derivatives are 
securities whose payoffs depend on the prices of other securities or commodities. 
For example, you can buy an option to purchase IBM shares at a fixed price on a 
fixed future date. The option’s payoff depends on the price of IBM shares on that 
date. Commodities can be traded by a different kind of derivative security called a 
futures contract.

Trump contracts declined. But as it became clear that Trump 
was headed toward a big victory in the New York primary in 
April, the price of Trump contracts dramatically recovered.
The red line in the figure is for “Rest of field” (i.e., a contract that will pay off $1 if anyone other than the named candidates in the figure wins the nomination). The 20 cent price for 
this contract in early April is evidence that even at this late 
date, there was meaningful uncertainty about the prospects 
for a contested convention in which someone other than the 
current leaders would be selected as the Republican candidate. By May, however, Trump futures were selling for $.92, 
and the "Rest of field" price had fallen to $.06.
Participants in prediction markets are putting their money 
where their mouth is. So the forecasting accuracy of these 
markets compares favorably with that of major polls. Some 
businesses have formed internal prediction markets to survey 
the views of their staff. For example, Google operates an 
internal market to forecast product launch dates, the number 
of Gmail users, and other strategic questions.*
* Google’s experience is analyzed in B. Cowgill, J. Wolfers, and E. Zitzewitz, 
“Using Prediction Markets to Track Information Flows: Evidence from Google,” 
working paper, Dartmouth College, January 2009.
Stock markets allow investors to bet on their favorite stocks. 
Prediction markets allow them to bet on almost anything else. 
These markets reveal the collective guess of traders on 
issues as diverse as New York City snowfall, an avian flu outbreak, and the occurrence of a major earthquake.
Prediction markets are conducted on a number of online 
exchanges such as PredictIt (www.predictit.org) and Iowa Electronic Markets (tippie.uiowa.edu/iem). Take the 2016 presidential primaries as an example. On the Iowa Electronic Markets 
you could have bet that Donald Trump would win the Republican nomination by buying one of his contracts. Each Trump 
contract promised to pay $1 if he won the nomination and nothing if he lost. If you thought that the probability of a Trump victory was 55% (say), you would have been prepared to pay up to 
$.55 for his contract. Someone who was relatively pessimistic 
about Trump’s chances would have been happy to sell you 
such a contract because that sale would turn a profit if he were 
to lose. With many participants buying and selling, the market 
price of a contract revealed the collective wisdom of the crowd.
Take a look at the accompanying figure from the Iowa 
Electronic Markets. It shows the contract prices for the various 
contenders for the Republican nomination between January 
and May 2016. You can see that as Ted Cruz beat Trump in a 
series of primaries and caucuses during March, the price of

Commodity and derivative markets are not sources of financing but markets where 
the financial manager can adjust the firm’s exposure to business risks. For example, an 
electric generating company may wish to lock in the future price of natural gas by trading in commodity markets, thus eliminating the risk of a sudden jump in the price of 
its raw materials.
Wherever there is uncertainty, investors may be interested in trading, either to speculate or to lay off their risks, and a market may arise to meet that trading demand. In 
recent years, several smaller markets have been created that allow punters to bet on a 
single event. The nearby box discusses how prices in these markets can reveal people’s 
predictions about the future.

Financial Intermediaries
A financial intermediary is an organization that raises money from investors and 
provides financing for individuals, companies, and other organizations. For corporations, intermediaries are important sources of financing. Intermediaries are a stop on 
the road between savings and real investment.
Why is a financial intermediary different from a manufacturing corporation? First, 
it may raise money in different ways, for example, by taking deposits or selling insurance policies. Second, it invests that money in financial assets, for example, in stocks, 
bonds, or loans to businesses or individuals. In contrast, a manufacturing company’s 
main investments are in plant, equipment, or other real assets.
We will start with two important classes of intermediaries, mutual funds and pension funds.
Mutual funds raise money by selling shares to investors. The investors’ money is 
pooled and invested in a portfolio of securities. Investors can buy or sell shares in 
mutual funds as they please, and initial investments are often $3,000 or less. Vanguard’s Explorer Fund, for example, held a portfolio of more than 700 stocks with a 
market value of about $10 billion in early 2016. An investor in Explorer can increase 
her stake in the fund’s portfolio by buying additional shares, and so gain a higher share 
of the portfolio’s subsequent dividends and price appreciation.2
 She can also sell her 
shares back to the fund if she decides to cash out of her investment.3
The advantages of a mutual fund should be clear: Unless you are very wealthy, you 
cannot buy and manage a 700-stock portfolio on your own, at least not efficiently. 
Mutual funds offer investors low-cost diversification and professional management. For most investors, it’s more efficient to buy a mutual fund than to assemble a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.
Most mutual fund managers also try their best to “beat the market,” that is, to generate 
superior performance by finding the stocks with better-than-average returns. Whether 
they can pick winners consistently is another question, which we address in Chapter 7.
In exchange for their services, the fund’s managers take out a management fee. 
There are also the expenses of running the fund. For Explorer, fees and expenses 
absorb about .5% of portfolio value each year. This seems reasonable, but watch out: 
The typical mutual fund charges more than Explorer does. In some cases, fees and 
expenses add up to 2% per year. That’s a big bite out of your investment return.
Mutual funds are a stop on the road from savings to corporate investment. Suppose 
Explorer purchases part of the new issue of shares by Bank of America. Again we 
show the flow of savings to investment by orange arrows:
financial intermediary
An organization that raises 
money from investors and 
provides financing for 
individuals, corporations, 
or other organizations.
mutual funds
An investment company 
that pools the savings of 
many investors and invests 
in a portfolio of securities.
2
 Mutual funds are not corporations but investment companies. They pay no tax, providing that all income from 
dividends and price appreciation is passed on to the funds’ shareholders. The shareholders pay personal tax on 
this income.
3
 Explorer, like most mutual funds, is an open-end fund. It stands ready to issue shares to new investors in the fund and 
to buy back existing shares when its shareholders decide to cash out. The purchase and sale prices depend on the fund’s 
net asset value (NAV) on the day of purchase or redemption. Closed-end funds have a fixed number of shares traded on 
an exchange. If you want to invest in a closed-end fund, you must buy shares from another stockholder in the fund.

U.S. mutual funds
There are about 8,000 mutual funds in the United States. In fact, there are more mutual 
funds than public companies! The funds pursue a wide variety of investment strategies. 
Some funds specialize in safe stocks with generous dividend payouts. Some specialize in 
high-tech growth stocks. Some “balanced” funds offer mixtures of stocks and bonds. 
Some specialize in particular countries or regions. For example, the Fidelity Investments 
mutual fund group sponsors funds for Canada, Japan, China, Europe, and Latin America.

Like mutual funds, hedge funds also pool the savings of different investors and 
invest on their behalf. But they differ from mutual funds in at least two ways. First, 
because hedge funds usually follow complex, high-risk investment strategies, access is 
usually restricted to knowledgeable investors such as pension funds, endowment funds, 
and wealthy individuals. Don’t try to send a check for $3,000 or $5,000 to a hedge 
fund; most hedge funds are not in the “retail” investment business. Second, hedge 
funds try to attract the most talented managers by compensating them with potentially 
lucrative, performance-related fees.4
 In contrast, mutual funds usually charge a fixed 
percentage of assets under management.
Hedge funds follow many different investment strategies. Some try to make a profit 
by identifying overvalued stocks or markets and selling short. (We will not go into 
procedures for short-selling here. Just remember that short-sellers profit when prices 
fall.5
) “Vulture funds” specialize in the securities of distressed corporations. Some 
hedge funds take bets on firms involved in merger negotiations, others look for mispriced convertible bonds, and some take positions in currencies and interest rates. 
Hedge funds manage less money than mutual funds, but they sometimes take very big 
positions and have a large impact on the market.
There are other ways of pooling and investing savings. Consider a pension plan set 
up by a corporation or other organization on behalf of its employees. There are several 
types of pension plan. The most common type of plan is the defined-contribution plan. 
In this case, a percentage of the employee
