s of a small, thinly traded company all at once, you will probably 
knock down the price to some extent. If you’re patient and don’t surprise other investors with a large, sudden sell order, you may be able to unload your shares on better 
terms. It’s the same problem that you may face in selling real estate. A house or condominium is not a liquid asset in a panic sale. If you’re determined to sell in an afternoon, you’re not going to get full value.
The Payment Mechanism
Think how inconvenient life would be if you had to pay for every purchase in cash or 
if Boeing had to ship truckloads of hundred-dollar bills around the country to pay its 
suppliers. Checking accounts, credit cards, and electronic transfers allow individuals

the real estate developer and other borrowers. These loans are not liquid. This raises the specter of bank runs, 
where doubts about a bank’s ability to pay off its depositors cause a rush of withdrawals, with each depositor

are the obvious providers of payment services, but they are not alone. For example, if 
you buy shares in a money market mutual fund, your money is pooled with that of 
other investors and used to buy safe, short-term securities. You can then write checks 
on this mutual fund investment, just as if you had a bank deposit.
