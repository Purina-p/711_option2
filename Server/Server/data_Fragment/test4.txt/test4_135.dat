the first time that different 
countries have agreed on a common currency. In 1865 
France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy came together in 
the Latin Monetary Union, and they were joined by Greece 
and Romania the following year. Members of the European 
Monetary Union (EMU) hope that the euro will be a longerlasting success than this earlier experiment. As we write 
this in early 2016, the euro appears to have weathered 
the worst of the crisis caused by the Greek government’s 
debt default. (Chapter 23)
2002 Financial Scandals A seemingly endless series of 
financial and accounting scandals climaxed in this year.

accounting firm, Arthur Andersen), WorldCom, and the
