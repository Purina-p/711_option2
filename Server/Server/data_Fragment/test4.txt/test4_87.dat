ever a 
corporation invests cash in a new project, its shareholders lose the opportunity to 
invest the cash on their own. Corporations increase value by accepting investment 
projects that earn more than the opportunity cost of capital.
Figure 1.3, which compares rates of return on investment projects with the opportunity cost of capital, illustrates a general principle: A corporation should direct cash to 
investments that add market value, compared with the investments that shareholders 
could make on their own.7
opportunity cost of capital
Expected rate of return 
given up by investing in a 
project rather than in the 
capital market.
FIGURE 1.3 The firm can 
either keep and reinvest cash or 
return it to investors. (Arrows 
represent possible cash flows or 
transfers.) If cash is reinvested, 
the opportunity cost is the 
expected rate of return that 
shareholders could have 
obtained by investing in 
financial assets.

 We have mentioned 5% or 20% as possible future rates of return on Virgin Atlanticâ€™s new planes. We will see 
in Chapter 8 that future rates of return are sometimes difficult to calculate and interpret. The general 
principle always holds, however. In Chapters 8 and 9 we show you how to apply the principle by calculating 
the net present value (NPV) of investment projects.
