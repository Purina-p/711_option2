ssage. 
If enough shareholders bail out, the stock price tumbles, which damages top managers’ compensation and reputation.
Takeovers The Wall Street Walk also opens the door for takeovers. The further the 
stock price falls, the easier it is for another company to buy up the majority of shares 
and take over. The old management team is then likely to find itself out on the street. 
We discuss takeovers in Chapter 21.
Information for Investors Corporate governance can’t work unless outside investors 
get detailed, up-to-date information. If a firm is transparent—if investors can see its true 
profitability and prospects—then problems will show up right away in a falling stock 
price. That in turn generates extra scrutiny from security analysts, bond rating agencies, 
and banks and other lenders, who keep an eagle eye on the progress of their borrowers.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sets accounting and reporting standards for public companies. We cover accounting and finance in Chapter 3.
Chapter 1 is not the right place for a worldwide tour of corporate governance. But be 
aware that governance laws, regulations, and practice vary. The differences are more 
dramatic in continental Europe and Japan than in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other English-speaking countries. In Germany, for example, banks often control 
large blocks of stock and can push hard for changes in the management or strategy of 
poorly performing companies. (Banks in the United States are prohibited from large or 
permanent holdings of the stock of nonfinancial corporations.) Large German firms also 
have two boards of directors: the supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) and the management 
board (Vorstand). Half of the supervisory board’s members are elected by employees. 
Some French firms also have two boards, one including employee representatives.
1.6 The Ethics of Maximizing Value
Shareholders want managers to maximize the market value of their shares. But perhaps this begs the question: Is it desirable for managers to act in the narrow, selfish 
interest of their shareholders? Does a focus on shareholder value mean that the managers must act as greedy mercenaries riding roughshod over widows and orphans?
Most of this book is devoted to financial policies that increase value. None of these 
policies requires galloping over widows and orphans. In most instances, there is little 
conflict between doing well (maximizing value) and doing good. The first step in doing 
well is doing good by your customers. Here is how Adam Smith put the case in 1776:
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our 
dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity 
but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.10
Profitable firms are those with satisfied customers and loyal employees; firms with 
dissatisfied customers and a disgruntled workforce will probably end up with declining profits and a low stock price.11
Of course, ethical issues do arise in business as in other walks of life. When the 
stakes are high, it is often tempting for managers to cut corners. Laws and regulations 
seek to prevent managers from undertaking dishonest actions. But written rules and 
laws can help only so much. In business, as in other day-to-day affairs, there are also

unwritten rules of behavior. They are reinforced because good managers know that 
their firm’s reputation is one of its most important assets, and therefore playing fair 
and keeping one’s word are simply good business practices. Thus financial deals are 
regularly sealed by a handshake, and each side knows that the other will not renege 
later if things turn sour.
Reputation is particularly important in finance. If you buy a well-known brand in a 
supermarket, you can be fairly sure of what you are getting. But in financial transactions, the other party often has more information than you, and it is less easy to be sure 
of the quality of what you are buying. Therefore, honest financial firms seek to build 
long-term relationships with their customers and to establish a name for fair dealing 
and financial integrity. Major banks and securities firms protect their reputations.
When something happens to undermine reputations, the costs can be enormous. 
Volkswagen (VW) is a recent case in point. VW had installed secret software that cut 
back pollution from its diesel cars, but only when the cars were tested. Actual pollution in regular driving was much higher—and far in excess of legal maximums. 
Discovery of the software scandal in 2015 caused a tidal wave of opprobrium. VW’s 
stock price dropped by 35%. Its CEO was fired. VW diesel vehicles piled up unsold on 
car dealers’ lots. Potential fines imposed by the U.S. and European governments could 
be enormous. VW set aside $7.3 billion to cover costs and losses, but some analysts 
viewed this amount as much too low.
Charlatans and swindlers sometimes prey on individual investors, especially in 
booming markets. (It’s only “when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been 
swimming naked.”12) The tide went out in 2008 and a number of frauds were exposed. 
One notorious example was the Ponzi scheme run by the disgraced financier Bernard 
Madoff (pronounced “Made-off ”).13 Individuals and institutions invested around 
$20 billion with Madoff and were told that their investments had grown to $65 billion. 
That figure turned out to be completely fictitious. (It’s not clear what Madoff did with 
all this money, but much of it was apparently paid out to early investors in the scheme to 
create an impression of superior investment performance.) With hindsight, the investors 
should not have trusted Madoff or the financial advisers who steered money to him.
Madoff’s Ponzi scheme was (we hope) a once-in-a-lifetime event. (Ponzi schemes 
pop up frequently, but few have approached the scope and duration of Madoff’s.) 
It was astonishingly unethical and illegal and was bound to end in tears. Needless to 
say, it was not designed to add value for investors.

The Great Albanian 
Ponzi Scheme
12 The quotation is from Warren Buffett’s annual letter to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, March 2008.
13 Ponzi schemes are named after Charles Ponzi, who founded an investment company in 1920 that promised 
investors unbelievably high returns. He was soon deluged with funds from investors in New England, taking in 
$1 million during one 3-hour period. Ponzi invested only about $30 of the money that he raised. But he used part of 
the cash provided by later investors to pay generous dividends to the original investors, thus promoting the illusion 
of high profits and quick payoffs. Within months the scheme collapsed and Ponzi started a 5-year prison sentence.
Without knowing anything about the personal ethics of the owners, which 
company would you trust more to keep its word in a business deal?
a. Harry’s Hardware has been in business for 50 years. Harry’s grandchildren, 
now almost adults, plan to take over and operate the business. Successful 
hardware stores depend on long-term loyal customers.
b. Victor’s Videos just opened for business. It rents a storefront in a strip mall 
and has financed its inventory with a bank loan. Victor has little of his own 
money invested in the business. Video shops usually command little 
customer loyalty.

But sometimes raids can enhance shareholder value. For 
example, in 2012 and 2013, Relational Investors teamed up 
with the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CSTRS, 
a pension fund) to try to force Timken Co. to split into two 
separate companies, one for its steel business and one for its 
industrial bearings business. Relational and CSTRS believed 
that Timken’s combination of unrelated businesses was unfocused and inefficient. Timken management responded that 
breakup would “deprive our shareholders of long-run value—
all in an attempt to create illusory short-term gains through 
financial engineering.” But Timken’s stock price rose at the 
prospect of a breakup, and a nonbinding shareholder vote on 
Relational’s proposal attracted a 53% majority. Finally in 2014 
Timken spun off its steel business in a new corporation, 
Timken Steel.
How do you draw the ethical line in such examples? Was 
Relational Investors a “raider” (sounds bad) or an “activist 
investor” (sounds good)? Breaking up a portfolio of businesses can create difficult adjustments and job losses. Some 
stakeholders lose. But shareholders and the overall economy 
can gain if businesses are managed more efficiently.
Tax Avoidance
In 2012 it was revealed that during the 14 years that Starbucks 
had operated in the United Kingdom, it paid hardly any taxes. 
Public outrage led to a boycott of Starbucks shops, and the 
company responded by promising that it would voluntarily 
pay to the taxman about $16 million more than it was required 
to pay by law. Several months later, a U.S. Senate committee 
investigating tax avoidance by U.S. technology firms reported 
that Apple had used a “highly questionable” web of offshore 
entities to avoid billions of dollars of U.S. taxes.
Multinational companies, such as Starbucks and Apple, 
could reduce their tax bills using legal techniques with exotic 
names such as the “Dutch Sandwich,” “Double Irish,” and 
“Check-the-Box.” But the public outcry over the revelations 
suggested that many believed that use of these techniques, 
though legal, was unethical. If they were unethical, that leaves 
an awkward question: How do companies decide which tax 
schemes are ethical and which are not? Can a company act in 
shareholders’ interest if it voluntarily pays more taxes than it 
is legally obligated to pay?
