Financial markets help channel savings to corporate investment, and they help match up 
borrowers and lenders. They provide liquidity and diversification opportunities for investors. Trading in financial markets provides a wealth of useful information for the financial 
manager.
Financial institutions carry out a number of similar functions to financial markets but in 
different ways. They channel savings to corporate investment, and they serve as financial 
intermediaries between borrowers and lenders. Banks also provide liquidity for depositors and, of course, play a special role in the economy’s payment systems. Insurance companies allow policyholders to pool risks.
The financial crisis of 2007–2009 provided a dramatic illustration. The huge expansion in 
subprime mortgage lending in the United States led to a collapse of the banking system. 
The government was forced into costly bailouts of banks and other financial institutions. 
As the credit markets seized up, the country suffered a deep recession. In much of Europe, 
the financial crisis did not end in 2009. As governments struggled to reduce their debt 
mountains and to strengthen their banking systems, many countries suffered sharp falls in 
economic activity and severe unemployment.
Do financial institutions 
have different functions?
