emes and awards to top management. Boards usually 
delegate decision making for small and medium-size investments, but the authority to 
approve large investments is almost never delegated.
The board of directors is elected by shareholders and is supposed to represent their 
interests. Boards have been portrayed as passive supporters of top management, but 
the balance has tipped toward independence. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) 
requires that more directors be independent—that is, not affiliated with management. 
The majority of directors are now independent. Boards must also meet in executive 
sessions with the CEO not present. SOX also requires CEOs and CFOs to sign off 
personally on the corporation’s accounting procedures and results.
Activist Shareholders Institutional shareholders, including pension funds, have 
become more active in monitoring management and pushing for changes. CEOs have 
been forced out as a result, including the CEOs of JCPenney, Procter & Gamble, Barnes 
& Noble, Citigroup, Yahoo!, and Carnival. Boards outside the United States, which 
have traditionally been more management-friendly, have also become more willing to 
replace underperformers. The list of foreign companies with CEO departures includes 
Barclays, Carrefour, Siemens, Barrick, and Rio Tinto.
Although U.S. corporations typically have thousands of individual shareholders, 
they often also have blockholders, that is, investors who own 5%, 10%, or more of 
outstanding shares. The blockholders may include wealthy individuals or families—
for example, descendants of a founder. They may also include other corporations, 
pension funds, or foundations.9
