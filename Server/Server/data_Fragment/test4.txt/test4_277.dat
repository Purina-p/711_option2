ities represents the amount of the 
shareholders’ equity. This is the basic balance sheet identity. Shareholders are sometimes called “residual claimants” on the firm. We mean by this that shareholders’ 
equity is what is left over when the liabilities of the firm are subtracted from its assets:
 Shareholders’ equity = net assets = total assets − total liabilities (3.1)

 Here is an occasional source of confusion. You may be tempted to think of retained earnings as a pile of cash that 
the company has built up from its past operations. But there is absolutely no link between retained earnings and 
cash balances. The earnings that Home Depot has plowed back into the business may have been used to buy new 
equipment, trucks, warehouses, and so on. Typically only a small proportion will be kept in the bank. Notice that 
Home Depot’s balance sheet lists $26,995 in retained earnings but only $1,723 in cash and marketable securities.
