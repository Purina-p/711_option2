 We 
discuss the important differences between income and 
cash flow and between book values and market values. 
We also discuss the federal tax system.
This chapter is our first look at financial statements 
and is meant primarily to serve as a brief review of your 
accounting class. It will be far from our last look. For 
example, we will see in the next chapter how managers 
use financial statements to analyze a firm’s performance 
and assess its financial strength.
Accounting is not the same as finance, but the two are related.
