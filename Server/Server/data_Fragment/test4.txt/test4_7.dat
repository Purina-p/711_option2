for sole 
proprietorships but don’t want to reorganize as corporations? For example, suppose 
you wish to pool money and expertise with some friends or business associates. 
You can form a partnership and enter into a partnership agreement that sets out 
how decisions are to be made and how profits are to be split up. Partners, like sole 
proprietors, face unlimited liability. If the business runs into difficulties, each partner 
can be held responsible for all the business’s debts.
Partnerships have a tax advantage. Partnerships, unlike corporations, do not have 
to pay income taxes. The partners pay personal income taxes on their shares of 
the profits.
Some businesses are hybrids that combine the tax advantage of a partnership with 
the limited liability advantage of a corporation. In a limited partnership, partners 
are classified as general or limited. General partners manage the business and have 
unlimited personal liability for its debts. Limited partners are liable only for the money 
they invest and do not participate in management.
Many states allow limited liability partnerships (LLPs) or limited liability companies (LLCs). These are partnerships in which all partners have limited liability. 
Another variation on the theme is the professional corporation (PC), which is 
commonly used by doctors, lawyers, and accountants. In this case, the business 
has limited liability, but the professionals can still be sued personally, for example, 
for malpractice.
Most large investment banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs started 
life as partnerships. But eventually these companies and their financing requirements 
grew too large for them to continue as partnerships, and they reorganized as corporations. The partnership form of organization does not work well when ownership is 
widespread and separation of ownership and management is essential.
1.3 Who Is the Financial Manager?
What do financial managers do for a living? That simple question can be answered in 
several ways. We can start with financial managers’ job titles. Most large corporations 
have a chief financial officer (CFO), who oversees the work of all financial staff. 
As you can see from Figure 1.1, the CFO is deeply involved in financial policy and 
financial planning and is in constant contact with the chief executive officer (CEO) 
and other top management. The CFO is the most important financial voice of the 
corporation and explains earnings results and forecasts to investors and the media.

Below the CFO are usually a treasurer and a controller. The treasurer looks after 
the firm’s cash, raises new capital, and maintains relationships with banks and other 
investors that hold the firm’s securities. The controller prepares the financial statements, manages the firm’s internal budgets and accounting, and looks after its tax 
affairs. Thus the treasurer’s main function is to obtain and manage the firm’s capital, 
whereas the controller ensures that the money is used efficiently.

In large corporations, financial managers are responsible for organizing and supervising the capital budgeting process. However, major capital investment projects are 
so closely tied to plans for product development, production, and marketing that 
managers from these other areas are inevitably drawn into planning and analyzing the 
projects. If the firm has staff members specializing in corporate planning, they are 
naturally involved in capital budgeting too. For this reason, we will use the term financial manager to refer to anyone responsible for an investment or financing decision. 
Often we will use the term collectively for all the managers drawn into such decisions.
Now let’s go beyond job titles. What is the essential role of the financial manager? 
Figure 1.2 gives one answer. The figure traces how money flows from investors to the 
corporation and back again to investors. The flow starts when cash is raised from 
investors (arrow 1 in the figure). The cash could come from banks or from securities 
sold to investors in financial markets. The cash is then used to pay for the real assets 
(investment projects) needed for the corporation’s business (arrow 2). Later, as the 
business operates, the assets generate cash inflows (arrow 3). That cash is either 
reinvested (arrow 4a) or returned to the investors who furnished the money in the first 
place (arrow 4b). Of course, the choice between arrows 4a and 4b is constrained by the 
promises made when cash was raised at arrow 1. For example, if the firm borrows 
money from a bank at arrow 1, it must repay this money plus interest at arrow 4b.
You can see examples of arrows 4a and 4b in Table 1.1. Facebook financed its 
investments by reinvesting earnings (arrow 4a). Procter & Gamble decided to return 
cash to shareholders by buying back its stock (arrow 4b). It could have chosen instead 
to pay the money out as additional cash dividends, also on arrow 4b.
Notice how the financial manager stands between the firm and outside investors. 
On the one hand, the financial manager is involved in the firm’s operations,

particularly by helping to make good investment decisions. On the other hand, he or 
she deals with financial institutions and other investors and with financial markets 
such as the New York Stock Exchange. We say more about these financial institutions 
and markets in the next chapter.
1.4 Goals of the Corporation
Shareholders Want Managers to Maximize Market Value
For small corporations, shareholders and management may be one and the same. 
But for large corporations, separation of ownership and management is a practical 
necessity. For example, Walmart has nearly 300,000 shareholders. There is no way 
that these shareholders can be actively involved in management; it would be like trying 
to run New York City by town meetings. Authority has to be delegated.
How can shareholders effectively delegate decision making when they all have 
different tastes, wealth, time horizons, personal opportunities, and tolerance for 
risk? Delegation can work only if the shareholders have a common goal. Fortunately 
there is a natural financial objective on which almost all shareholders can agree: 
Maximize the current market value of shareholders’ investment in the firm.
This simple, unqualified goal makes sense when the shareholders have access to 
well-functioning financial markets and institutions. Access gives them the flexibility 
to manage their own savings and consumption plans, leaving the corporation’s financial managers with only one task, to increase market value. For example, a corporation’s roster of shareholders will usually include both risk-averse and risk-tolerant 
investors. You might expect the risk-averse to say, “Sure, maximize value, but don’t 
touch too many high-risk projects.” Instead, they say, “Risky projects are okay, provided that expected profits are more than enough to offset the risks. If this firm ends 
up too risky for my taste, I’ll adjust my investment portfolio to make it safer.” 
For example, the risk-averse shareholder can shift more of his or her portfolio to safe 
assets, such as U.S. government bonds. Shareholders can also just say good-bye, 
selling off shares of the risky firm and buying shares in a safer one. If the risky investments increase market value, the departing shareholders are better off than they would 
be if the risky investments were turned down.

Value Maximization
Fast-Track Wireless shares trade for $20. It has just announced a “bet the company” 
investment in a high-risk, but potentially revolutionary, WhyFi technology. Investors note the 
risk of failure but are even more impressed with the technology’s upside. They conclude 
that the possibility of very high future profits justifies a higher share price. The price goes 
up to $23.
Caspar Milquetoast, a thoughtful but timid shareholder, notes the downside risks and 
decides that it’s time for a change. He sells out to more risk-tolerant investors. But he sells at 
$23 per share, not $20. Thus he captures the value added by the WhyFi project without 
having to bear the project’s risks. Those risks are transferred to other investors, who are 
more risk-tolerant or more optimistic.
In a well-functioning stock market, there is always a pool of investors ready to bear 
downside risks if the upside potential is sufficiently attractive. We know that the upside 
potential was sufficient in this case, because Fast-Track stock attracted investors willing to 
pay $23 per share. ■

The same principles apply to the timing of a corporation’s cash flows, as the 
following Self-Test illustrates.
Sometimes you hear managers speak as if the corporation has other goals. For 
example, they may say that their job is to “maximize profits.” That sounds reasonable. 
After all, don’t shareholders want their company to be profitable? But taken literally, 
profit maximization is not a well-defined corporate objective. Here are two reasons:
1. Maximize profits? Which year’s profits? A corporation may be able to increase 
current profits by cutting back on outlays for maintenance or staff training, but that 
will not add value unless the outlays were wasteful in the first place. Shareholders 
will not welcome higher short-term profits if long-term profits are damaged.
2. A company may be able to increase future profits by cutting this year’s dividend 
and investing the freed-up cash in the firm. That is not in the shareholders’ best 
interest if the company earns only a very low rate of return on the extra investment.
Maximizing—or at least maintaining—value is necessary for the long-run survival 
of the corporation. Suppose, for example, that its managers forget about value and decide 
that the only goal is to increase the market share of its products. So the managers cut 
prices aggressively to attract new customers, even when this leads to continuing losses. 
As losses mount, the corporation finds it more and more difficult to borrow money and 
sooner or later cannot pay existing debts. Nor can it raise new equity financing if shareholders see that new equity investment will follow previous investments down the drain.
This firm’s managers would probably pay the price for this business malpractice. 
For example, outside investors would see an opportunity for easy money. They could 
buy the firm from its current shareholders, toss out the managers, and reemphasize 
value rather than market share. The investors would profit from the increase in value 
under new management.
Managers who pursue goals that destroy value often end in early retirement—
another reason that the natural financial goal of the corporation is to maximize 
market value.
The Investment Trade-Off Okay, let’s take the objective as maximizing market 
value, or at least adding market value. But why do some investments increase market 
value, while others reduce it? The answer is given by Figure 1.3, which sets out the 
fundamental trade-off for corporate investment decisions. The corporation has a 
proposed investment project (the purchase of a real asset). Suppose it ha
