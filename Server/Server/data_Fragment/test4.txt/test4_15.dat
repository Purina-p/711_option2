’s monthly paycheck is contributed to a 
pension fund. (The employer and employee may each contribute 5%, for example.) 
Contributions from all participating employees are pooled and invested in securities or 
mutual funds. (Usually the employees can choose from a menu of funds with different 
investment strategies.) Each employee’s balance in the plan grows over the years as 
contributions continue and investment income accumulates. The balance in the plan 
can be used to finance living expenses after retirement. The amount available for 
retirement depends on the accumulated contributions and on the rate of return earned 
on the investments.6
Pension funds are designed for long-run investment. They provide professional 
management and diversification. They also have an important tax advantage: Contributions are tax-deductible, and investment returns inside the plan are not taxed until 
cash is finally withdrawn.7
Pension plans are among the most important vehicles for savings. Total assets held 
by U.S. pension plans were about $15 trillion in 2015.
hedge funds

strategies.

 Sometimes these fees can be very large indeed. For example, Forbes estimated that the top hedge fund manager in 2012 earned $2.2 billion in fees.

 A short-seller borrows a security from another investor and sells it. Of course, the seller must sooner or later 
buy the security back and return it to its original owner. The short-seller earns a profit if the security can be 
bought back at a lower price than it was sold for.
6
 In a defined-benefit plan, the employer promises a certain level of retirement benefits (set by a formula) and 
the employer invests in the pension plan. The plan’s accumulated investment value has to be large enough to 
cover the promised benefits. If not, the employer must put in more money. Defined-benefit plans are gradually 
giving way to defined-contribution plans.
7
 Defined-benefit pension plans share these same advantages, except that the employer invests rather than the 
employees. In a defined-benefit plan, the advantage of tax deferral on investment income accrues to the 
employer. This deferral reduces the cost of funding the plan.
Individual investors can buy bonds and stocks directly, or they can put their 
money in a mutual fund or a defined-contribution pension fund. What are the 
advantages of the second strategy?

Financial Institutions
Banks and insurance companies are financial institutions.8
 A financial institution is 
an intermediary that does more than just pool and invest savings. Institutions raise 
financing in special ways, for example, by accepting deposits or selling insurance policies, and they provide additional financial services. Unlike a mutual fund, they not 
only invest in securities but also lend money directly to individuals, businesses, or 
other organizations.
Commercial Banks There are about 5,400 commercial banks in the United States.9
They vary from giants such as JPMorgan Chase with $2.6 trillion of assets to relative 
dwarfs like Cambridge Bancorp with assets of $1.7 billion.
Commercial banks are major sources of loans for corporations. (In the United 
States, they are generally not allowed to make equity investments in corporations, 
although banks in most other countries can do so.) Suppose that a local forest 
products company negotiates a 9-month bank loan for $2.5 million. The flow of 
savings is:

 We may be drawing too fine a distinction between financial intermediaries and institutions. A mutual fund 
could be considered a financial institution. But “financial institution” usually suggests a more complicated intermediary, such as a bank.
9
 Banks that accept deposits and provide financing mostly to businesses are called commercial banks. Savings 
banks and savings & loans (S&Ls) accept deposits and lend mostly to individuals, for example, as mortgage 
loans to home buyers.
10 Investment banks do not take deposits and do not lend money to businesses or individuals, except as bridge 
loans made as temporary financing for takeovers or other transactions. Investment banks are sometimes called 
merchant banks.
Company Bank
(Institution) Issues debt to bank
$2.5 million
Investors
(Depositors) Accepts deposits
$2.5 million
The bank provides debt financing for the company and, at the same time, provides 
a place for depositors to park their money safely and withdraw it as needed.
Investment Banks We have discussed commercial banks, which raise money from 
depositors and other investors and then make loans to businesses and individuals. 
Investment banks are different. Investment banks do not generally take deposits or 
make loans to companies.10 Instead, they advise and assist companies in obtaining 
finance. For example, investment banks underwrite stock offerings by purchasing the 
new shares from the issuing company at a negotiated price and reselling the shares to 
investors. Thus the issuing company gets a fixed price for the new shares, and the 
investment bank takes responsibility for distributing the shares to investors. We discuss share issues in more detail in Chapter 15.
Investment banks also advise on takeovers, mergers, and acquisitions. They offer 
investment advice and manage investment portfolios for individual and institutional 
investors. They run trading desks for foreign exchange, commodities, bonds, options, 
and other derivatives.
Investment banks can invest their own money in start-ups and other ventures. 
For example, the Australian Macquarie Bank has invested in airports, toll highways, electric transmission and generation, and other infrastructure projects around 
the world.

The largest investment banks are financial powerhouses. They include Goldman 
Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lazard, Nomura (Japan), and Macquarie Bank.11 In addition, 
the major commercial banks, including Bank of America and Citigroup, all have 
investment banking operations.12
Insurance Companies Insurance companies are more important than banks for 
the long-term financing of business. They are massive investors in corporate stocks 
and bonds, and they often make long-term loans directly to corporations.
Suppose a company needs a loan of $2.5 million for 9 years, not 9 months. It could 
issue a bond directly to investors, or it could negotiate a 9-year loan with an insurance 
company:
11 The distinction between investment and commercial banks is not a legal one. Since 2008 both Goldman Sachs 
and Morgan Stanley have held banking licenses and are supervised by the Federal Reserve. However, they are 
not in the business of taking retail deposits or providing loans.
12 Bank of America owns Merrill Lynch, one of the largest investment banks. Merrill was rescued by Bank of 
America in 2009 after making huge losses from mortgage-related investments.
Company Insurance company
(Institution) Issues debt
$2.5 million
Investors
(Policyholders) Sells policies
$2.5 million
The money to make the loan comes mainly from the sale of insurance policies. Say 
you buy a fire insurance policy on your home. You pay cash to the insurance company 
and get a financial asset (the policy) in exchange. You receive no interest payments on 
this financial asset, but if a fire does strike, the company is obliged to cover the damages up to the policy limit. This is the return on your investment. (Of course, a fire is a 
sad and dangerous event that you hope to avoid. But if a fire does occur, you are better 
off getting a payoff on your insurance policy than not having insurance at all.)
The company will issue not just one policy but thousands. Normally the incidence 
of fires “averages out,” leaving the company with a predictable obligation to its policyholders as a group. Of course, the insurance company must charge enough for its policies to cover selling and administrative costs, pay policyholders’ claims, and generate 
a profit for its stockholders.
Total Financing of U.S. Corporations
The pie chart in Figure 2.3 shows the investors in bonds and other debt securities. 
Notice the importance of institutional investors—mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and banks. Households (individual investors) hold less than 5% of the 
debt pie. The other slices represent the rest of the world (investors from outside the 
United States) and other, smaller categories of investors.
The pie chart in Figure 2.4 shows holdings of the shares issued by U.S. corporations. Here, households make a stronger showing, with 37.2% of the total. Pension

funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds add up to 45.9% of the total. Remember, banks in the United States do not usually hold stock in other companies. The restof-the-world slice is 16.0%.
The aggregate amounts represented in these figures are enormous. There is 
$11.9 trillion of debt behind Figure 2.3 and $34.1 trillion of equity behind Figure 2.4 
($34,100,000,000,000).
Chapter 14 reviews corporate financing patterns in more detail.
Functions of Financial Markets 
and Intermediaries
Financial markets and intermediaries provide financing for business. They channel 
savings to real investment. That much should be loud and clear from Sections 2.1 and 
2.2 of this chapter. But there are other functions that may not be quite so obvious.

Transporting Cash across Time
Individuals need to transport expenditures in time. If you have money now that you 
wish to save for a rainy day, you can (for example) put the money in a savings account 
at a bank and withdraw it with interest later. If you don’t have money today, say to buy 
a car, you can borrow money from the bank and pay off the loan later. Modern finance 
provides a kind of time machine. Lenders transport money forward in time; borrowers 
transport it back. Both are happier than if they were forced to spend income as it 
arrives. Of course, individuals are not alone in needing to raise cash from time to time.
