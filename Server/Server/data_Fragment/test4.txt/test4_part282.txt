 each of these sections in turn.
The first section, cash flow from operations, starts with net income but adjusts that 
figure for those parts of the income statement that do not involve cash coming in or 
going out. Therefore, it adds back the allowance for depreciation because depreciation 
is not a cash outflow, even though it is treated as an expense in the income statement.
Any additions to current assets (other than cash itself) need to be subtracted from 
net income
