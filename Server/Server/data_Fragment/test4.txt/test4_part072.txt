they can 
invest on their own.
In our example, the minimum acceptable rate of return on Virgin’s new aircraft 
is 10%. This minimum rate of return is called the hurdle rate or opportunity cost of 
capital. It is called an opportunity cost of capital because it depends on the alternative 
investment opportunities available to shareholders in financial markets. Whenever a 
corporation invests cash in a new project, its shareholders lose the opportunity to 
invest the cash on their own. Corporations increase value by accepting investment 
projects that earn more than the opportunity cost of capital.
Figure 1.3, which compares rates of return on investment projects with the opportunity cost of capital, illustrates a general principle: A corporation should direct cash to 
investments that add market value, compared with the investments that shareholders 
could make on their own.7

either keep and reinvest cash or 
return it to investors. (Arrows 
represent possible cash flows or

the opportunity cost is the 
expected rate of return that 
shareholders could have 
obtained by investing in 
financial assets.

 We have mentioned 5% or 20% as possible future rates of return on Virgin Atlantic’s new planes. We will see 
in Chapter 8 that future rates of return are sometimes difficult to calculate and interpret.
