SUMMARY
Investors and other stakeholders in the firm need regular financial information to help 
them monitor the firm’s progress. Accountants summarize this information in a balance 
sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows.
The balance sheet provides a snapshot of the firm’s assets and liabilities. The assets 
consist of current assets that can be rapidly turned into cash and fixed assets such as plant 
and machinery. The liabilities consist of current liabilities that are due for payment within 
a year and long-term debts. The difference between the assets and the liabilities represents 
the amount of the shareholders’ equity.
The income statement measures the profitability of the company during the year. 
It shows the difference between revenues and expenses.
The statement of cash flows measures the sources and uses of cash during the year. 
The change in the company’s cash balance is the difference between sources and uses.
It is important to distinguish between the book values that are shown in the company 
accounts and the market values of the assets and liabilities. Book values are historical 
measures based on the original cost of an asset. For example, the assets in the balance sheet 
are shown at their historical cost less an allowance for depreciation. Similarly, the figure 
for shareholders’ equity measures the cash that shareholders have contributed in the past or 
that the company has reinvested on their behalf. In contrast, market value is the current 
price of an asset or liability.
Income is not the same as cash flow. There are two reasons for this: (1) Investment in fixed 
assets is not deducted immediately from income but is instead spread (as charges for depreciation) over the expected life of the equipment, and (2) the accountant records revenues 
when the sale is made, rather than when the customer actually pays the bill, and at the same 
time deducts the production costs even though those costs may have been incurred earlier.
For large companies the marginal rate of tax on income is 35%. In calculating taxable 
income the company deducts an allowance for depreciation and interest payments. It cannot deduct dividend payments to the shareholders.
Individuals are also taxed on their income, which includes dividends and interest on 
their investments. Capital gains are taxed, but only when the investment is sold and the 
gain realized.

QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS
1. Financial Statements. Earlier in the chapter, we characterized the balance sheet as providing a 
snapshot of the firm at one point in time and the income statement as providing a video. What 
did we mean by this? Is the statement of cash flow more like a snapshot or a video? (LO3-1)
2. Balance Sheet. Balance sheet items are usually entered in order of declining liquidity. Place
