as described by the figure in Panel a, at the bottom of this box.
The typical mortgage was long term, up to 30 years maturity, with a fixed interest rate. The S&Ls’ liabilities—chiefly savings accounts—had much shorter maturities, perhaps a year 
or two on average. The S&Ls were therefore “borrowing 
short, lending long,” a dangerous investment strategy. When 
interest rates rose in the 1970s and 1980s, the S&Ls’ interest 
costs on savings accounts rose, too, but their interest income 
was locked up in long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. Losses 
mounted. The S&L crisis of the 1980s followed.*
The invention of the MBS allowed S&Ls to eliminate the risks 
of borrowing short and lending long. You can still get a mortgage 
from your local S&L, but now the S&L does not have to keep it. 
The S&L originates the mortgage, but will probably resell it to an 
MBS issuer—for example, Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association or FNMA†) or Bank of America. The issuer combines your mortgage with hundreds or thousands of others and 
issues an MBS backed by the combined portfolio. The MBS is 
sold to investors such as life insurance companies that want to 
hold long-term, fixed-rate obligations. Cash flows from the mortgage portfolio are passed through to investors.‡
Suppose a life insurance company purchases an MBS. The 
flow of savings would now match the figure in Panel b.

*For a history of the crisis, see Edward J. Kane, The S&L Insurance Mess: How 
Did It Happen? (Washington, D.C.: Urban Institute Press, 1989).
†Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) are 
government-sponsored entities (GSEs) charged with increasing the availability 
of mortgage credit. The GSEs purchase “conforming loans” and package and 
resell them as MBSs. Nonconforming loans—for example, large, “jumbo” 
mortgages—are packaged by banks such as Citigroup or Bank of America.
‡ You still send monthly payments to your local S&L. The S&L extracts a small 
servicing fee and sends your payments along to the MBS issuer, which also 
extracts a small servicing fee. Net cash flows from the portfolio
