to keep track of the cash that is coming in and going out.
We have seen that the firm’s cash flow can be quite different from its net income. 
These differences can arise for at least two reasons:
1. The income statement does not recognize capital expenditures as expenses in the 
year that the capital goods are paid for. Instead, it spreads those expenses over time 
in the form of an annual deduction for depreciation.
2. The income statement uses the accrual method of accounting, which means that 
revenues and expenses are recognized when sales are made, rather than when the 
cash is received or paid out.
The statement of cash flows shows the firm’s cash inflows and outflows from operations as well as from its investments and financing activities. Table 3.4 is the cash-flow 
statement for Home Depot. It contains three sections. The first shows the cash flow from 
operations. This is the cash generated from Home Depot’s normal business activities. 
Next comes the cash that Home Depot has invested in plant and equipment or in the 
acquisition of new businesses. The final section reports cash flows from financing activities such as the sale of new debt or stock. We will look at each of these sections in turn.
The first section, cash flow from operations, starts with net income but adjusts that 
figure for those parts of the income statement that do not involve cash coming in or 
going out. Therefore, it adds back the allowance for depreciation because depreciation 
is not a cash outflow, even though it is treated as an expense in the income statement.
Any additions to current assets (other than cash itself) need to be subtracted from 
net income because these absorb cash but do not show up in the income statement. 
Conversely, any additions to current liabilities need to be added to net income because 
these release cash. For example, you can see that the increase of $86 million in accounts

statement of cash flows
Financial statement that 
shows the firm’s cash 
receipts and cash payments 
over a period of time.
Period: 2 3 4
 Sales (income statement) 100 120 0
− Investment in receivables (balance sheet) 100 −100 + 120 = 20 −120
= Cash received 0 +100 +120
The following table provides a similar reconciliation of the difference between the revenues shown in the income statement and the cash inflow:
In the income statement the accountant records sales of $100 in period 1 and $120 in 
period 2. The fact that the firm has to wait for payment is recognized in the balance sheet as 
an investment in receivables. The cash that the company receives is equal to the sales 
shown in the income statement less the investment in receivables. ■
Consider a firm that spends $200 to produce goods in period 1. In period 2, 
it sells half of those goods for $150, but it doesn’t collect payment until one 
period later. In period 3, it sells the other half of the goods for $150, and it 
collects payment on these sales in period 4. Calculate the profits and the cash 
flows for this firm in periods 1 to 4.

receivable is deducted from income. In addition, Home Depot increased inventories by 
$22 million. This increase in inventory levels also absorbed cash and must be deducted 
from net income when calculating cash flows. On the other hand, Home Depot does 
not pay all its bills immediately. These delayed payments show up as payables. 
In 2014, Home Depot had larger bills outstanding than a year earlier: Accounts 
payable increased by $94 million. Delaying these payments freed up extra cash.
We have pointed out that depreciation is not a cash payment; it is simply the accountant’s allocation to the current year of the original cost of the capital equipment. 
However, cash does flow out the door when the firm actually buys and pays for 
new capital equipment. Therefore, these capital expenditures are set out in the second 
section of the cash-flow statement. You can see that Home Depot spent $1,289 million 
on new capital equipment. Notice that (gross) property, plant, and equipment on 
Home Depot’s balance sheet increased by precisely this amount. On the other hand, 
Home Depot freed up $31 million by selling off other investments. Total cash used by 
investments was $1,258 million.
Finally, the third section of the cash-flow statement shows the cash from financing 
activities. For example, Home Depot raised $2,178 million by issuing long-term debt. 
But it paid out $2,530 million to stockholders in the form of dividends and used 
another $7,000 million to repurchase stock.7
To summarize, the cash-flow statement tells us that Home Depot generated $8,127 
million from operations, spent $1,258 million on new investments, and used $7,075 
million in financing activities. Home Depot earned and raised less cash than it spent.

 You might think that interest payments also ought to be listed in this section. However, it is usual to include 
interest in the first section with cash flow from operations. This is because, unlike dividends, interest payments 
are not discretionary. The firm must pay interest when a payment comes due, so these payments are treated as a 
business expense rather than as a financing decision.
