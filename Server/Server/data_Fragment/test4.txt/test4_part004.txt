different from investing in an open-end mutual fund. In that case you have to send 
money to the fund in exchange for newly issued shares. And, if you want to withdraw 
the investment, you have to notify the fund, which redeems your shares and sends you 
a check. Also, many of the larger ETFs charge lower fees than mutual funds. State 
Street Global Advisors charges just .11% a year for managing the Standard & Poor’s 
500 Index Spider. For a $100,000 investment, the fee is only .0011 × 100,000 = $110.
Financial markets provide other mechanisms for sharing risks. For example, a 
wheat farmer and a baking company are each exposed to fluctuations in the price of 
wheat after the harvest. The farmer worries about low prices, the baker about high 
prices. They can both rest easier if the baker can agree with the farmer to buy wheat in 
the future at a fixed price. Of course, it would be difficult, to say the least, if the baker 
and the farmer had to contact an Internet dating service to get together to make a deal. 
Fortunately, no dating service is needed: Each can trade in commodity markets, the 
farmer as a seller and the baker as a buyer.
Liquidity
Markets and intermediaries also provide liquidity, that is, the ability to turn an investment back into cash when needed. Suppose you deposit $5,000 in a savings bank on 
February 1. During that month, the bank uses your deposit and other new deposits to 
make a 6-month construction loan to a real estate developer. On March 1, you realize 
that you need your $5,000 back. The bank can give it to you. Because the bank has 
thousands of depositors, and other sources of financing if necessary, it can make an 
illiquid loan to the developer financed by liquid deposits made by you and other custome
