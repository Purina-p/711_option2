Cash retained and reinvested in the firm‚Äôs operations is cash saved and invested 
on behalf of the firm‚Äôs shareholders.
Of course, a small corporation has other financing choices. It could take out a bank 
loan, for example. The bank in turn may have raised money by attracting savings 
accounts. In this case, investors‚Äô savings flow through the bank to the firm.
Now consider a large, public corporation, for example, Apple Computer in 
September 2015. What‚Äôs different? Scale, for one thing: Apple‚Äôs annual revenues for 
the previous 12 months were $234 billion, and its balance sheet showed total assets of 
$290 billion. The scope of Apple‚Äôs activities has also expanded: It now has dozens of 
product lines and operates worldwide. Because of this scale and scope, Apple attracts 
investors‚Äô savings by a variety of different routes. It can do so because it is a large, 
profitable, public firm.
The flow of savings to large public corporations is shown in Figure 2.2. Notice two 
key differences from Figure 2.1. First, public corporations can draw savings from investors worldwide. Second, the savings flow through financial markets, financial intermediaries, or both. Suppose, for example, that Bank of America raises $900 million by a 
new issue of shares. An Italian investor buys 4,000 of the new shares for $15 per share. 
Now Bank of America takes that $60,000, along with money raised by the rest of the 
issue, and makes a $300 million loan to Apple. The Italian investor‚Äôs savings end up 
flowing through financial markets (the stock market), to a financial intermediary (Bank 
of America), and finally to Apple.
Of course, our Italian friend‚Äôs $60,000 doesn‚Äôt literally arrive at Apple in an envelope marked ‚ÄúFrom L. DaVinci.‚Äù Investments by the purchasers of the Bank of 
America‚Äôs stock issue are pooled, not segregated. Signor DaVinci would own a share 
of all of Bank of America‚Äôs assets, not just one loan to Apple. Nevertheless, investors‚Äô 
savings are flowing through the financial markets and the bank to finance Apple‚Äôs 
capital investments.
