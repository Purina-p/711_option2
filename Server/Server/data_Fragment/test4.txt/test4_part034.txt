of the Christmas holidays, Walmart spends nearly $50 billion to stock up its warehouses and retail stores. As the goods are sold over the following months, the company 
recovers its investment in these inventories.

billion to acquire the British software company Autonomy. Just 13 months later, 
HP wrote down the value of this investment by $8.8 billion. HP claimed that it was
