undertaking of great advantage but nobody to know what it 
is.” Within 5 hours he had raised £2,000; within 6 hours he 
was on his way out of the country. Readers nearly two centuries later could only wonder at the naïve or foolhardy 
investors in these ventures—that is, until they had a chance 
to participate in the follies unearthed by the financial crisis 
of 2008–2009. (Chapter 2)
1792 Formation of the New York Stock Exchange The New 
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was founded in 1792 when a 
group of brokers met under a buttonwood tree* and 
arranged to trade shares with one another at agreed rates 
of commission. Today the NYSE is the largest stock 
exchange in the world, trading on average about 1.5 billion 
shares a day. (Chapter 7)
1929 Stock Market Crashes Common stocks are risky investments. In September 1929 stock prices in the United 
States reached an all-time high, and the economist Irving 
Fisher forecast that they were at “a permanently high plateau.” Some 3 years later, stock prices were almost 90% 
lower, and it was to be a quarter of a century before the 
prices of September 1929 were seen again. Eighty years 
later, history came close to repeating itself. After stock 
prices peaked in July 2007, they slumped over the next 20 
months by 54%. (Chapter 11)
1960s Eurodollar Market In the 1950s the Soviet Union transferred its dollar holdings from the United States to a 
Russian-owned bank in Paris. This bank was best known 
by its telex address, eurobank, and consequently dollars 
held outside the United States came to be known as eurodollars. In the 1960s, U.S. taxes and regulation made it 
much cheaper to borrow and lend dollars in Europe than in 
the United States, and a huge market in eurodollars arose. 
(Chapter 14)
1971 Corporate Bankruptcies Every generation of investors 
is shocked and surprised by a major corporate bankruptcy. 
In 1971 the Penn Central Railroad, a pillar of American 
industry, suddenly collapsed. At that time, it was the largest corporate bankruptcy in history. In 2008, the investment bank Lehman Brothers smashed Penn Central’s 
record. (Chapter 16)
1972 Financial Futures Financial futures allow companies to 
protect themselves against fluctuations in interest rates, 
exchange rates, and so on. It is said that they originated 
from a remark by the economist Milton Friedman that 
he was unable to profit from his view that sterling (the U.K. 
currency) was overpriced. The Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange founded the first financial futures market. 
Today futures exchanges trade 6 billion contracts a year of 
financial futures. (Chapter 24)
1986 Capital Investment Decisions The largest investment 
project undertaken by a single private company was the 
construction of the tunnel under the English Channel. This 
started in 1986 and was completed in 1994 at a total cost 
of $15 billion. The cost of the Gorgon natural gas project in 
Australia is estimated at $54 billion. (Chapters 8, 9)
1988 Mergers The 1980s saw a wave of takeovers culminating in the $25 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco. Over a 
Date unknown Compound Growth Bacteria start to propagate by subdividing. They thereby demonstrate the power 
of compound growth. (Chapter 5)
c. 1800 b.c. Interest Rates In Babylonia, Hammurabi’s Code 
established maximum interest rates on loans. Borrowers 
often mortgaged their property and sometimes their 
spouses, but lenders were obliged to return spouses in 
good condition within 3 years. (Chapter 6)
c. 1000 b.c. Options One of the earliest recorded options is 
described by Aristotle. The philosopher Thales knew by 
the stars that there would be a great olive harvest, so, having a little money, he bought options for the use of olive 
presses. When the harvest came, Thales was able to rent 
the presses at great profit. Today financial managers need 
to be able to evaluate options to buy or sell a wide variety 
of assets. (Chapter 23)
15th century International Banking Modern international 
banking had its origins in the great Florentine banking 
houses. But the entire European network of the Medici 
empire employed only 57 people in eight offices. Today 
the London-based bank HSBC has around 260,000 
employees in 71 different countries. (Chapter 14)
1650 Futures Futures markets allow companies to protect 
themselves against fluctuations in commodity prices. 
During the Tokugawa era in Japan, feudal lords collected 
rents in the form of rice, but often they wished to trade 
their future rice deliveries. Rice futures therefore came to 
be traded on what was later known as the Dojima Rice 
Market. Rice futures are still traded, but now companies 
can also trade in futures on a range of items from pork bellies to stock market indexes. (Chapter 24)
17th century Joint Stock Corporations Although investors 
have for a long time combined together as joint owners 
of an enterprise, the modern corporation with a large number of stockholders originated with the formation in England 
of trading firms like the East India Company (est. 1599). 
(Chapter 15)
17th century Money America has been in the forefront in the 
development of new types of money. Early settlers often 
used a shell known as wampum. For example, Peter 
Stuyvesant raised a loan in wampum, and in Massachusetts it was legal tender. Unfortunately, the enterprising 
settlers found that with a little dye the relatively common 
white wampum shells could be converted profitably into 
the more valuable black ones, which confirmed Gresham’s 
law that bad money drives out good. The first issue of 
paper money in America was by the Massachusetts Bay 
Colony in 1690, and other colonies soon set their printing 
presses to producing money. In 1862 Congress agreed to 
an issue of paper money that would be legal tender. These 
notes, printed in green ink, immediately became known as 
“greenbacks.” (Chapters 19, 20)
1720 New-Issue Speculation From time to time investors 
have been tempted by speculative new issues. During 
the South Sea Bubble in England, one company was 
launched to develop perpetual motion. Another enterprising individual announced a company “for carrying on an

eight other countries. This is not the first time that different 
countries have agreed on a common currency. In 1865 
France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy came together in 
the Latin Monetary Union, and they were joined by Greece 
and Romania the following year. Members of the European 
Monetary Union (EMU) hope that the euro will be a longerlasting success than this earlier experiment. As we write 
this in early 2016, the euro appears to have weathered 
the worst of the crisis caused by the Greek government’s 
debt default. (Chapter 23)
2002 Financial Scandals A seemingly endless series of 
financial and accounting scandals climaxed in this year. 
Resulting bankruptcies included the icons Enron (and its 
accounting firm, Arthur Andersen), WorldCom, and the 
Italian food company Parmalat. Congress passed the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act to increase the accountability of corporations and executives. (Chapters 1, 14)
2007–2009 Subprime Mortgages Subprime mortgages are 
housing loans made to homeowners with shaky credit 
standing. After a decade in which housing prices had consistently gone up, lenders became complacent about the 
risks of these home loans and progressively loosened 
lending standards. When housing prices stalled and interest rates increased in 2007, many of these loans went bad. 
Some large banks such as Lehman Brothers went to the 
wall, while others such as Wachovia and Merrill Lynch 
were rescued with the aid of government money. 
(Chapters 2, 14)
2011 Defaults on Sovereign Debt By 2010 the Greek government had amassed a huge $460 billion of debt. Other 
eurozone governments and the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) rushed to Greece’s aid, but their assistance 
was insufficient, and in 2011 the Greek government 
defaulted on $100 billion of debt. It was the largest-ever 
sovereign default. Investors nervously eyed other highly 
indebted eurozone countries. (Chapter 2)

period of 6 weeks, three groups battled for control of the 
company. As one of the contestants put it, “We were 
charging through the rice paddies, not stopping for 
anything and taking no prisoners.” The takeover was the 
largest in history and generated almost $1 billion in fees 
for the banks and advisers. (Chapter 21)
1993 Inflation Financial managers need to recognize the 
effect of inflation on interest rates and on the profitability 
of the firm’s investments. In the United States inflation has 
been relatively modest, but some countries have suffered 
from hyperinflation. In Hungary after World War II, the government issued banknotes worth 1,000 trillion pengoes. In 
Yugoslavia in October 1993, prices rose by nearly 2,000% 
and a dollar bought 105 million dinars. The inflation rate in 
Venezuela in late 2015 was about 180%. (Chapter 5)
1780 and 1997 Inflation-Indexed Debt In 1780, Massachusetts paid Revolutionary War soldiers with interest-bearing 
notes rather than its rapidly eroding currency. Interest and 
principal payments on the notes were tied to the subsequent rate of inflation. After a 217-year hiatus, the U.S. 
Treasury issued inflation-indexed notes called TIPS 
(Treasury Inflation Protected Securities). Many other countries, including Britain and Israel, had done so previously. 
(Chapter 6)
1993 Controlling Risk When a company fails to keep close 
tabs on the risks being taken by its employees, it can get 
into serious trouble. This was the fate of Barings, a 
220-year-old British bank that numbered the queen among 
its clients. In 1993 it discovered that Nick Leeson, a trader 
in its Singapore office, had hidden losses of $1.3 billion 
(£869 million) from unauthorized bets on the Japanese 
equity market. The losses wiped out Barings and landed 
Leeson in jail, with a 6-year sentence. In 2008 a rogue 
trader at Morgan Stanley established a new record by losing $9 billion on unauthorized deals. (Chapter 24)
1999 The Euro Large corporations do business in many 
currencies. In 1999 a new currency came into existence 
when 11 European countries adopted the euro in place of 
their separate currencies. They have since been joined by

SUMMARY
Financial management can be broken down into (1) the investment or capital budgeting 
decision and (2) the financing decision. The firm has to decide (1) which real assets to 
invest in and (2) how to raise the funds necessary to pay for those investments.
Real assets include all assets used in the production or sale of the firms’ products or 
services. They can be tangible (plant and equipment, for example) or intangible (patents 
or trademarks, for example). In contrast, financial assets (such as stocks or bonds) are 
claims on the income generated by real assets.
Corporations are distinct, permanent legal entities. They allow for separation of ownership and control, and they can continue operating without disruption even as management 
or ownership changes. They provide limited liability to their owners. On the other hand, 
What are the two major 
decisions made by financial 
managers? (LO1-1)
What does “real asset” 
mean? (LO1-2)
What are the advantages 
and disadvantages of 
forming a corporation?

26 Part One Introduction
managing the corporation’s legal machinery is costly. Also, corporations are subject to 
double taxation, because they pay taxes on their profits and the shareholders are taxed 
again when they receive dividends or sell their shares at a profit.
Almost all managers are involved to some degree in investment decisions, but some managers specialize in finance, for example, the treasurer, controller, and CFO. The treasurer
is most directly responsible for raising capital and maintaining relationships with banks 
and investors that hold the firm’s securities. The controller is responsible for preparing 
financial statements and managing budgets. In large firms, a chief financial officer
oversees both the treasurer and the controller and is involved in financial policymaking and 
corporate planning.
Value maximization is the natural financial goal of the firm. Shareholders can invest 
or consume the increased wealth as they wish, provided that they have access to 
well-functioning financial markets.
Companies either can invest in real assets or can return the cash to shareholders, who can 
invest it for themselves. The return that shareholders can earn for themselves is called the 
opportunity cost of capital. Companies create value for shareholders whenever they can 
earn a higher return on their investments than the opportunity cost of capital.
Conflicts of interest between managers and stockholders can lead to agency problems
and agency costs. Agency problems are kept in check by financial controls, by welldesigned compensation packages for managers, and by effective corporate governance.
Shareholders do not want the maximum possible stock price; they want the maximum 
honest price. But there need be no conflict between value maximization and ethical behavior. The surest route to maximum value starts with products and services that satisfy 
customers. A good reputation with customers, employees, and other stakeholders is 
important for the firm’s long-run profitability and value.

stock price should be less subject to an overemphasis on short-term results than one that simply 
maximizes profits. (LO1-5)
17. Goals of the Firm. Fritz is risk-averse and is content with a relatively low but safe return on his 
investments. Frieda is risk-tolerant and seeks a very high rate of return on her invested savings. 
Yet both shareholders will applaud a high-risk capital investment if it offers a superior rate of 
return. Why? What is meant by “superior”? (LO1-5)
18. Goals of the Firm. We claim that the goal of the firm is to maximize current market value. 
Could the following actions be consistent with that goal? (LO1-5)
a. The firm adds a cost-of-living adjustment to the pensions of its retired employees.
b. The firm reduces its dividend payment, choosing to reinvest more earnings in the business.
c. The firm buys a corporate jet for its executives.
d. The firm drills for oil in a remote jungle. The chance of finding oil is only 1 in 5.
19. Goals of the Firm. Fill in the blanks in the following passage by choosing the most appropriate 
term from the following list (some of the terms may be used more than once or not used at all): 
expected return, financial assets, lower, market value, higher, opportunity cost of capital, real 
assets, dividend, shareholders. (LO1-5)
 Shareholders want managers to maximize the _____ of their investments. The firm faces a 
trade-off. Either it can invest its cash in _____ or it can give the cash back to _____ in the form 
of a(n) _____ and they can invest it in _____. Shareholders want the company to invest in _____ 
only if the _____ is _____ than they could earn for themselves in equivalent risk investments. 
The return that shareholders could earn for themselves is therefore the _____ for the firm.
20. Goals of the Firm. Explain why each of the following may not be appropriate corporate goals. 
(LO1-5)
a. Increase market share
b. Minimize costs
c. Underprice any competitors
d. Expand profits
21. Goals of the Firm. We can imagine the financial manager doing several things on behalf of the 
firm’s stockholders. For example, the manager might do the following: 
a. Make shareholders as wealthy as possible by investing in real assets.
b. Modify the firm’s investment plan to help shareholders achieve a particular time pattern of 
consumption.
c. Choose high- or low-risk assets to match shareholders’ risk preferences.
d. Help balance shareholders’ checkbooks.
 However, in well-functioning capital markets, shareholders will vote for only one of these goals. 
Which one will they choose? (LO1-5)
22. Cost of Capital. British Quince comes across an average-risk investment project that offers a 
rate of return of 9.5%. This is less than the company’s normal rate of return, but one of Quince’s 
directors notes that the company can easily borrow the required investment at 7%. “It’s 
simple,” he says. “If the bank lends us money at 7%, then our cost of capital must be 7%. 
The project’s return is higher than the cost of capital, so let’s move ahead.” How would you 
respond? (LO1-5)
23. Cost of Capital. In a stroke of good luck, your company has uncovered an opportunity to invest 
for 10 years at a guaranteed 6% rate of return. How would you determine the opportunity cost of 
capital for this investment? (LO1-5)
24. Cost of Capital. Pollution Busters Inc. is considering a purchase of 10 additional carbon 
sequesters for $100,000 apiece. The sequesters last for only 1 year before becoming saturated. 
Then the carbon is sold to the government. (LO1-5)
a. Suppose the government guarantees the price of carbon. At this price, the payoff after 1 year 
is $115,000 for sure. How would you determine the opportunity cost of capital for this 
investment?
b. Suppose instead that the sequestered carbon has to be sold on the London Carbon Exchange. 
Carbon prices have been extremely volatile, but Pollution Busters’ CFO learns that average 
rates of return from investments on that exchange have been about 20%. She thinks this is a

reasonable forecast for the future. What is the opportunity cost of capital in this case? Is the 
purchase of additional sequesters a worthwhile capital investment?
25. Goals of the Firm. It is sometimes suggested that instead of seeking to maximize shareholder 
value and, in the process, pursuing profit, the firm should seek to maximize the welfare of all its 
stakeholders, such as its employees, its customers, and the community in which it operates. 
How far would this objective conflict with one of maximizing shareholder value? Do you think 
such an objective is feasible or desirable? (LO1-5)
26. Agency Issues. Many firms have devised defenses that make it much more costly or difficult for 
other firms to take them over. How might such takeover defenses affect the firm’s agency problems? Are managers of firms with formidable takeover defenses more or less likely to act in the 
firm’s interest rather than their own? (LO1-6)
27. Agency Issues. Sometimes lawyers work on a contingency basis. They collect a percentage of 
their clients’ settlements instead of receiving fixed fees. Why might clients prefer this arrangement? Would the arrangement mitigate an agency problem? Explain. (LO1-6)
28. Agency Issues. One of the “Finance through the Ages” episodes that we cited is the 1993 
collapse of Barings Bank, when one of its traders lost $1.3 billion. Traders are compensated in 
large part according to their trading profits. How might this practice have contributed to an 
agency problem? (LO1-6)
29. Agency Issues. When a company’s stock is widely held, it may not pay an individual shareholder to spend time monitoring managers’ performance and trying to replace poor performers. 
Explain why. Do you think that a bank that has made a large loan to the company is in a different 
position? (LO1-6)
30. Agency Issues. Company A pays its managers a fixed salary. Company B ties compensation to 
the performance of the stock. Which company’s compensation package would most effectively 
mitigate conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders? (LO1-6)
31. Corporate Governance. How do clear and comprehensive financial reports promote effective 
corporate governance? (LO1-6)
32. Corporate Governance. Some commentators have claimed that the U.S. system of corporate 
governance is “broken” and needs thorough reform. What do you think? Do you see systematic 
failures in corporate governance or just a few “bad apples”? (LO1-6)
33. Agency Issues. Which of the following forms of compensation is most likely to align the interests of managers and shareholders? (LO1-6)
a. A fixed salary
b. A salary linked to company profits
c. A salary that is paid partly in the form of the company’s shares
34. Agency Costs. What are agency costs? List some ways by which agency costs are mitigated. 
(LO1-6)
35. Reputation. As you drive down a deserted highway, you are overcome with a sudden desire for 
a hamburger. Fortunately, just ahead are two hamburger outlets; one is owned by a national 
brand, and the other appears to be owned by “Joe.” Which outlet has the greater incentive to 
serve you cat meat? Why? (LO1-7)
36. Ethics. In some countries, such as Japan and Germany, corporations develop close long-term relationships with one bank and rely on that bank for a large part of their financing needs. In the United 
States, companies are more likely to shop around for the best deal. Do you think that this practice 
is more or less likely to encourage ethical behavior on the part of the corporation? (LO1-7)
37. Ethics. Is there a conflict between “doing well” and “doing good”? In other words, are policies 
that increase the value of the firm (doing well) necessarily at odds with socially responsible 
policies (doing good)? When there are conflicts, how might government regulations or laws tilt 
the firm toward doing good? For example, how do taxes or fees charged on pollutants affect the 
firm’s decision to pollute? Can you cite other examples of “incentives” used by governments to 
align private interests with public ones? (LO1-7)
38. Ethics. Look at some of the practices described in the Finance in Practice box on ethic disputes 
in finance. What, if any, do you believe are the ethical issues involved? (LO1-7)

SOLUTIONS TO SELF-TEST QUESTIONS
1.1 a. The development of a microprocessor is a capital budgeting decision. The investment of 
$1 billion will purchase a real asset, the microprocessor design and production facilities.
b. The bank loan is a financing decision. This is how BMW will raise money for its 
investment.
c. Capital budgeting.
d. Capital budgeting. The marketing campaign should generate a real, though intangible, 
asset.
e. Both. The acquisition is an investment decision. The decision to issue shares is a financing 
decision.
1.2 a. A real asset. Real assets can be intangible assets.
b. Financial.
c. Real.
d. Financial.
e. Real.
f. Financial.
1.3 Fritz would more likely be the treasurer and Frieda the controller. The treasurer raises money 
from the financial markets and requires a background in financial institutions. The controller 
requires a background in accounting.
1.4 There is no reason for the Hotspurs to avoid high-dividend stocks, even if they wish to invest 
for tuition bills in the distant future. Their concern should be only with the risk and expected 
return of the shares. If a particular stock pays a generous cash dividend, they always have 
the option of reinvesting the dividend in that stock or, for that matter, in other securities. 
The dividend payout does not affect their ability to redirect current investment income to 
their future needs as they plan for their anticipated tuition bills.
1.5 Because investors can reasonably expect a 15% return in other investments in palladium, 
the firm should take this as the opportunity cost of capital for its proposed investment. 
Although the project is expected to show an accounting profit, its expected return is only 12%. 
Therefore, the firm should reject the project: Its expected return is less than the 15% expected 
return offered by equivalent-risk investments.
1.6 Agency problems arise when managers and shareholders have different objectives. Managers 
may empire-build with excessive investment and growth. Managers may be unduly riskaverse, or they may try to take excessive salaries or perquisites.
1.7 Harry’s has a far bigger stake in the reputation of its business than Victor’s. The store has been 
in business for a long time. The owners have spent years establishing customer loyalty. 
In contrast, Victor’s has just been established. The owner has little of his own money tied up 
in the firm, and so has little to lose if the business fails. In addition, the nature of the business 
results in little customer loyalty. Harry’s is probably more reliable.

f a corporation needs to issue more shares of stock, 
then its financial manager had better understand how 
the stock market works. If it wants to take out a bank 
loan, the financial manager had better understand how 
banks and other financial institutions work. If the firm 
contemplates a capital investment, such as a factory 
expansion or a new product launch, the financial manager needs to think clearly about the cost of the capital 
that the firm raises from outside investors. As we pointed 
out in Chapter 1, the opportunity cost of capital for the 
firm is the rate of return that its stockholders expect to 
get by investing on their own in financial markets. This 
means that the financial manager must understand how 
prices are determined in the financial markets in order 
to make wise investment decisions.
Financial markets and institutions are the firm’s financial environment. You don’t have to know everything 
about that environment to begin the study of financial 
management, but a general understanding provides 
useful context for the work ahead. For example, it will 
help you to understand why you are calculating the 
yield to maturity of a bond in Chapter 6, the net present 
value of a capital investment in Chapter 9, or the 
weighted-average cost of capital for a company in 
Chapter 13.
This chapter does three things. First, it surveys financial markets and institutions. We will cover the stock and 
bond markets, banks and insurance companies, and 
mutual and pension funds. Second, we will set out the 
functions of financial markets and institutions and look 
at how they help corporations and the economy. Third, 
we will discuss the financial crisis of 2007–2009 and 
the eurozone crisis that followed. An understanding of 
what happens when financial markets do not function 
well is important for understanding why and how financial markets and institutions matter.

The Importance of Financial Markets 
and Institutions
In the previous chapter, we explained why corporations need to be good at finance in 
order to survive and prosper. All corporations face important investment and financing 
decisions. But, of course, those decisions are not made in a vacuum. They are made in 
a financial environment. That environment has two main segments: financial markets 
and financial institutions.
Businesses have to go to financial markets and institutions for the financing they 
need to grow. When they have a surplus of cash, and no need for immediate financing, 
they have to invest the cash, for example, in bank accounts or in securities. Let’s take 
Apple Computer Inc. as an example.
Table 2.1 presents a time line for Apple and examples of the sources of financing 
tapped by Apple from its start-up in a California garage in 1976 to its cash-rich status 
in 2016. The initial investment in Apple stock was $250,000. Apple was also able to 
get short-term financing from parts suppliers who did not demand immediate payment. 
Apple got the parts, assembled and sold the computers, and afterward paid off its 
accounts payable to the suppliers. (We discuss accounts payable in Chapter 19.) Then, 
2.1
TABLE 2.1 Examples of 
financing decisions by Apple 
Computer
April 1976: Apple Computer 
Inc. founded
Mike Makkula, Apple’s first chairman, invests $250,000 in 
Apple shares.
1976: First 200 computers 
sold
Parts suppliers give Apple 30 days to pay. (Financing from 
accounts payable.)
1978–79 Apple raises $3.5 million from venture capital investors.
December 1980: Initial 
public offering
Apple raises $91 million, after fees and expenses, by selling 
shares to public investors.
May 1981 Apple sells 2.6 million additional shares at $31.25 per share.
April 1987 Apple pays its first dividend at an annual rate of $.12 per share.
Early 1990s Apple carries out several share repurchase programs.
1994 Apple issues $300 million of debt at an interest rate of 6.5%.
1996–97: Apple reports a 
$740 million loss in the 
second quarter of 1996. Lays 
off 2,700 employees in 1997.
Dividend is suspended in February 1996. Apple sells $661 
million of debt to private investors in June 1996. The 
borrowing provides “sufficient liquidity” to execute Apple’s 
strategic plans and to “return the company to profitability.”
September 1997: Acquires 
assets of Power Computing 
Corp.
Acquisition is financed with $100 million of Apple stock.
2004: Apple is healthy and 
profitable, thanks to iMac, 
iPod, and other products.
Apple pays off the $300 million in long-term debt issued in 
1994, leaving the company with no long-term debt 
outstanding.
2005–13 Apple’s profits grow rapidly. It invests in marketable securities, 
which accumulate to $147 billion by June 2013.
2012–13 Apple announces plans to pay out $100 billion to 
shareholders over the next 3 years. It also borrows a record 
$17 billion.
2013–15 Apple’s Capital Return Program distributes cash to 
shareholders by paying dividends and repurchasing shares. 
The planned total distribution is $200 billion by 2017.
2015 Apple issues $14.5 billion in dollar-denominated debt, 
€4.8 billion in euro debt, as well as debt issued in U.K. 
pounds, Swiss francs, and Japanese yen.
February 2016 Apple’s market capitalization, the total market value of all 
its outstanding shares, is $521 billion, far in excess of the 
$119 billion cumulative investment by Apple’s shareholders. 
The cumulative investment includes $92 billion of retained 
earnings.

as Apple grew, it was able to obtain several rounds of financing by selling Apple shares 
to private venture capital investors. (We discuss venture capital in Chapter 15.) In 
December 1980, it raised $91 million in an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares to 
public investors. There was also a follow-up share issue in May 1981.1
After Apple became a public company, it could raise financing from many sources, 
and it was able to pay for acquisitions by issuing more shares. We show a few examples in Table 2.1.
Apple started paying cash dividends to shareholders in 1987, and it also distributed 
cash to investors by stock repurchases in the early 1990s. But Apple hit a rough patch 
in 1996 and 1997, and regular dividends were eliminated. The company had to borrow 
$661 million from a group of private investors in order to cover its losses and finance 
its recovery plan. However, the rough patch ended with the release of the iMac in 1998 
and the iPod in 2001. Apple’s profitability increased rapidly, and it was able to finance 
its growth by plowing back earnings into operations. These retained earnings had 
grown to $92 billion by September 2015.
As the twenty-first century progressed, Apple’s profits grew so fast that it piled up 
a cash mountain, which grew to more than $200 billion by 2016. It resumed cash dividends and started a massive program of share repurchases. Its Capital Return Program, 
which began in 2012, will distribute $200 billion in cash to its shareholders by 2017.
Apple is well known for its product innovations, including the Macintosh computer, 
the iPhone, and the iPad. Apple is not special because of financing. In fact, the story of 
its financing is not too different from that of many other successful companies. But 
access to financing was vital to Apple’s growth and profitability. Would we have iMac 
computers, iPhones, or iPads if Apple had been forced to operate in a country with a 
primitive financial system? Definitely not. A prosperous economy requires a wellfunctioning financial system.
A modern financial system offers financing in many different forms, depending on 
the company’s age, its growth rate, and the nature of its business. For example, Apple 
relied on venture capital financing in its early years and only later floated its shares in 
public stock markets. Still later, as the company matured, it turned to other forms of 
financing, including the examples given in Table 2.1. But the table does not begin to 
cover the range of financing channels open to modern corporations. We will encounter 
many other channels later in the book, and new channels are opening up regularly. The 
nearby box describes one recent financial innovation, micro-lending funds that make 
small loans to businesspeople in the poorer parts of the world.
The Flow of Savings to Corporations
The money that corporations invest in real assets comes ultimately from savings 
by investors. But there can be many stops on the road between savings and corporate investment. The road can pass through financial markets, financial intermediaries, or both.
Let’s start with the simplest case of a small, closely held corporation, like Apple in 
its earliest years. The orange arrows in Figure 2.1 show the flow of savings from shareholders in this simple setting. There are two possible paths: The firm can sell new 
shares, or it can reinvest cash back into the firm’s operations. Reinvestment means 
additional savings by existing shareholders. The reinvested cash could have been paid 
out to those shareholders and spent by them on personal consumption. By not taking 
and spending the cash, shareholders have reinvested their savings in the corporation.

 Many of the shares sold in the 1981 issue were previously held by Apple employees. Sale of these shares 
allowed the employees to cash out and diversify some of their Apple holdings but did not raise additional 
financing for Apple.

The interest rates on these micro loans are relatively high; 
this is because the cost of writing and administering such 
small loans is high and the loans are made in nations with 
weak currencies. However, default rates on the loans are only 
about 4%. “There is a deep pride in keeping up with payments,” says Deidre Wagner, an executive vice president of 
Starbucks, who invested $100,000 in a microfinance fund in 
2003. “In some instances, when an individual is behind on 
payments, others in the village may make up the difference.” 
Investors and borrowers know that when the micro loans are 
repaid, the money gets recycled into new loans, giving still 
more borrowers a chance to move up the economic ladder.

Vahid Hujdur had dreams of opening his own business. With 
about $200 of his own money and a $1,500 loan, he was able 
to rent space in the old section of Sarajevo, and he began 
repairing and selling discarded industrial sewing machines. 
After just 8 years, Hujdur has 10 employees building, installing, 
and fixing this industrial machinery. Hujdur didn’t get his initial 
loan from a local bank. “They were asking for guarantees that 
were impossible to get,” he recalls. Instead, the capital came 
from LOKmicro, a local financial institution specializing in 
microfinance—the lending of small amounts to the poor in 
developing nations to help them launch small enterprises.
Microfinance institutions get capital from individual and 
institutional investors via microfinance funds, which collect 
the investors’ money, vet the local lenders, offer them management assistance, and administer investors’ accounts.

Cash retained and reinvested in the firm’s operations is cash saved and invested 
on behalf of the firm’s shareholders.
Of course, a small corporation has other financing choices. It could take out a bank 
loan, for example. The bank in turn may have raised money by attracting savings 
accounts. In this case, investors’ savings flow through the bank to the firm.
Now consider a large, public corporation, for example, Apple Computer in 
September 2015. What’s different? Scale, for one thing: Apple’s annual revenues for 
the previous 12 months were $234 billion, and its balance sheet showed total assets of 
$290 billion. The scope of Apple’s activities has also expanded: It now has dozens of 
product lines and operates worldwide. Because of this scale and scope, Apple attracts 
investors’ savings by a variety of different routes. It can do so because it is a large, 
profitable, public firm.
The flow of savings to large public corporations is shown in Figure 2.2. Notice two 
key differences from Figure 2.1. First, public corporations can draw savings from investors worldwide. Second, the savings flow through financial markets, financial intermediaries, or both. Suppose, for example, that Bank of America raises $900 million by a 
new issue of shares. An Italian investor buys 4,000 of the new shares for $15 per share. 
Now Bank of America takes that $60,000, along with money raised by the rest of the 
issue, and makes a $300 million loan to Apple. The Italian investor’s savings end up 
flowing through financial markets (the stock market), to a financial intermediary (Bank 
of America), and finally to Apple.
Of course, our Italian friend’s $60,000 doesn’t literally arrive at Apple in an envelope marked “From L. DaVinci.” Investments by the purchasers of the Bank of 
America’s stock issue are pooled, not segregated. Signor DaVinci would own a share 
of all of Bank of America’s assets, not just one loan to Apple. Nevertheless, investors’ 
savings are flowing through the financial markets and the bank to finance Apple’s 
capital investments.
FIGURE 2.1 Flow of savings 
to investment in a closely held 
corporation. Investors use 
savings to buy additional shares. 
Investors also save when the

behalf.

The Stock Market
A financial market is a market where securities are issued and traded. A security is 
just a traded financial asset, such as a share of stock. For a corporation, the stock market is probably the most important financial market.
