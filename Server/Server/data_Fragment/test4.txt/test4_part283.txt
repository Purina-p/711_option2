 because these absorb cash but do not show up in the income statement. 
Conversely, any additions to current liabilities need to be added to net income because 
these release cash. For example, you can see that the increase of $86 million in accounts

statement of cash flows
Financial statement that 
shows the firm’s cash 
receipts and cash payments 
over a period of time.
Period: 2 3 4
 Sales (income statement) 100 120 0
− Investment in receivables (balance sheet) 100 −100 + 120 = 20 −120
= Cash received 0 +100 +120
The following table provides a similar reconciliation of the difference between the revenues shown in the income statement and the cash inflow:
In the income statement the accountant records sales of $100 in period 1 and $120 in 
period 2. The fact that the firm has to wait for payment is recognized in the balance sheet as 
an investment in receivables. The cash that the company receives is equal to the sales 
shown in the income statement less the investment in receivables. ■
Consider a firm that spends $200 to produce goods in period 1. In period 2, 
it sells half of those goods for $150, but it doesn’t collect payment until one 
period later. In period 3, it sells the other half of the goods for $150, and it 
collects payment on these sales in period 4. Calculate the profits and the cash 
flows for this firm in periods 1 to 4.

receivable is deducted from income. In addition, Home Depot increased inventories by 
$22 million. This increase in inventory levels also absorbed cash and must be deducted 
from net income when calculating cash flows. On the other hand, Home Depot does 
not pay all its bills immediately. These delayed payments show up as payables. 
In 2014, Home Depot had larger bills outstanding than a year earlier: Accounts 
payable increased by $94 million. Delaying these payments freed up extra cash.
We have pointed out that depreciation is not a cash payment; it is simply the accountant’s allocation to the current year of the original cost of the capital equipment. 
However, cash does flow out the door when the firm actually buys and pays for 
new capital equipment. Therefore, these capital expenditures are set out in the second 
section of the cash-flow statement. You can see that Home Depot spent $1,289 million 
on new capital equipment. Notice that (gross) property, plant, and equipment on 
Home Depot’s balance sheet increased by precisely this amount. On the other hand,
