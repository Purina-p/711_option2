y is doing, both its current performance and its future prospects. Thus an increase in stock price sends a positive signal from investors to 
managers.16 That is why top management’s compensation is linked to stock prices. A 
manager who owns shares in his or her company will be motivated to increase the 
company’s market value. This reduces agency costs by aligning the interests of managers and stockholders.
This is one important advantage of going public. A private company can’t use its 
stock price as a measure of performance. It can still compensate managers with shares, 
but the shares will not be valued in a financial market.
Cost of Capital Financial managers look to financial markets to measure, or at 
least estimate, the cost of capital for the firm’s investment projects. The cost of capital 
is the minimum acceptable rate of return on the project. Investment projects offering 
rates of return higher than their cost of capital are worthwhile because they add value; 
they make both the firm and its shareholders better off financially. Projects offering 
rates of return less than the cost of capital subtract value and should not be 
undertaken.17
Thus the hurdle rate for investments inside the corporation is actually set outside 
the corporation. The expected rate of return on investments in financial markets determines the opportunity cost of capital.
The opportunity cost of capital is generally not the interest rate that the firm pays on 
a loan from a bank or insurance company. If the company is making a risky investment, the opportunity cost of capital is the expected rate of return that investors can 
achieve in financial markets at the same level of risk. The expected rate of return on 
risky securities is normally well above the interest rate on corporate borrowing.
We introduced the cost of capital in Chapter 1, but this brief reminder may help to 
fix the idea. We cover the cost of capital in detail in Chapters 11 and 12.

market capitalization of Callaway 
Golf and other companies in 
March 2016. (Shares and market 
values in millions. Ticker symbols 
in parentheses.)
Number of Shares × Stock Price =
Market Capitalization  
($ millions)
Callaway Golf (ELY) 93.8 × $8.76 = $821
Alaska Air Group (ALK) 124.7 × $80.77 = $10,074
Entergy (ETR) 178.5 × $75.92 = $13,551
Yum! Brands (YUM) 408.7 × $77.77 = $31,875
General Electric (GE) 9,331.0 × $30.34 = $283,091

16 We can’t claim that investors’ assessments of value are always correct. Finance can be a risky and dangerous 
business—dangerous for your wealth, that is. With hindsight we see horrible mistakes by investors, for example, 
the gross overvaluation of Internet and telecom companies in 2000. On average, however, it appears that financial markets collect and assess information quickly and accurately. We’ll discuss this issue again in Chapter 7.
17 Of course, the firm may invest for other reasons. For example, it may invest in pollution control equipment for 
a factory. The equipment may not generate a cash return but may still be worth investing in to meet legal and 
ethical obligations.
