n computing free cash flow, as those payments are part of the distributions made to

It is often useful to ask what Home Depot’s free cash flow would have been if the 
company had been financed entirely by equity. In that case, all the free cash flow would 
belong to the shareholders. However, if Home Depot no longer paid out $830 million as 
interest, pretax income would be increased by that amount, and the company would pay an 
additional .35 × 830 = $290.50 million in tax. Thus, if the company was financed solely 
by equity, free cash flow would have been $7,699 − $290.50 = $7,408.50 million. ■

 For this reason, when we calculated cash flow from operations, we ignored the change in holdings of shortterm debt, even though this short-term debt is listed under current liabilities. We were interested only in the 
items of working capital that arose from the firm’s operations.
10 We can check the logic linking free cash flow to the statement of cash flows as follows:
