managers from these other areas are inevitably drawn into planning and analyzing the

Often we will use the term collectively for all the managers drawn into such decisions.
Now let’s go beyond job titles. What is the essential role of the financial manager? 
Figure 1.2 gives one answer. The figure traces how money flows from investors to the 
corporation and back again to investors. The flow starts when cash is raised from 
investors (arrow 1 in the figure). The cash could come from banks or from securities 
sold to investors in financial markets. The cash is then used to pay for the real assets 
(investment projects) needed for the corporation’s business (arrow 2). Later, as the 
business operates, the assets generate cash inflows (arrow 3). That cash is either 
reinvested (arrow 4a) or returned to the investors who furnished the money in the first 
place (arrow 4b). Of course, the choice between arrows 4a and 4b is constrained by the 
promises made when cash was raised at arrow 1. For example, if the firm borrows 
money from a bank at arrow 1, it must repay this money plus interest at arrow 4b.
