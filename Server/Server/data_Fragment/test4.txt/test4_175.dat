ing or IPO. The buyers of the IPO are helping to 
finance the firm’s investment in real assets. In return, the buyers become part-owners 
of the firm and participate in its future success or failure. (Most investors in the Internet IPOs of 1999 and 2000 are by now sorely disappointed, but many IPOs pay off 
handsomely. If only we had bought Apple shares on their IPO day in 1980 . . .) Of 
course a corporation’s IPO is not its last chance to issue shares. For example, Bank of 
America went public in the 1930s, but it could make a new issue of shares tomorrow.
A new issue of shares increases both the amount of cash held by the company and 
the number of shares held by the public. Such an issue is known as a primary issue,
and it is sold in the primary market. But in addition to helping companies raise new 
cash, financial markets also allow investors to trade securities among themselves. For 
example, Smith might decide to raise some cash by selling her Apple stock at the same 
time that Jones invests his spare cash in Apple. The result is simply a transfer of ownership from Smith to Jones, which has no effect on the company itself. Such purchases 
and sales of existing securities are known as secondary transactions, and they take 
place in the secondary market. Notice that Smith and Jones might be less happy for 
Apple to raise new capital and invest in long-term projects if they could not sell their 
stock in the secondary market when they needed the cash for personal use.
Stock markets are also called equity markets because stockholders are said to own 
the common equity of the firm. You will hear financial managers refer to the capital 
structure decision as “the choice between debt and equity financing.”
Now may be a good time to stress that the financial manager plays on a global stage 
and needs to be familiar with markets around the world. For example, Apple’s stock is 
traded on the NASDAQ market and also in Germany on the Deutsche Börse. China
