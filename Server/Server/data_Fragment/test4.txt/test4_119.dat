assist firms in mergers and acquisitions. When firms issue securities or try to take over 
another firm, a lot of money is at stake and the firms may need to move fast. Thus, 
working for an investment bank can be a high-pressure activity with long hours. It can 
also pay very well.
The insurance industry is another large employer. Much of the insurance industry is 
involved in designing and selling insurance policies on people’s lives and property, but 
businesses are also major customers. So, if you work for an insurance company or a 
large insurance broker, you could find yourself arranging insurance on a Boeing 787 in 
the United States or an oil rig in Indonesia.
Life insurance companies are major lenders to corporations and to investors in commercial real estate. (Life insurance companies deploy the insurance premiums received 
from policyholders into medium- or long-term loans; banks specialize in shorter-term 
financing.) So you could end up negotiating a $50 million loan for construction of a 
new shopping center or investigating the creditworthiness of a family-owned manufacturing company that has applied for a loan to expand production.

Major New York Bank
I joined the bank after majoring in finance. I spent the first 
6 months in the bank’s training program, rotating among 
departments. I was assigned to the European markets 
team just before the 2010 Greek crisis, when worries about 
a possible default caused interest rates on Greek government debt to jump to more than 4% above the rate on 
comparable German government de
