n the accounting profession 
began to come of age.
We don’t want to get lost in the details of accounting 
practice. But because we will refer to financial statements throughout this book, it may be useful to review 
briefly their main features. In this chapter, we introduce 
the major financial statements: the balance sheet, the 
income statement, and the statement of cash flows. We 
discuss the important differences between income and 
cash flow and between book values and market values. 
We also discuss the federal tax system.
This chapter is our first look at financial statements 
and is meant primarily to serve as a brief review of your 
accounting class. It will be far from our last look. For 
example, we will see in the next chapter how managers 
use financial statements to analyze a firm’s performance 
and assess its financial strength.
Accounting is not the same as finance, but the two are related.
