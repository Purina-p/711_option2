Figure 4.1. For now you can read the figure as an organization chart that locates
some important financial ratios and shows how they relate to the objective of
shareholder value.
Now we start at the top of the figure. Our first task is to measure value. We will
explain market capitalization, market value added, and the market-to-book ratio.
Measuring Market Value and Market Value Added
Twenty years have passed since your introductory finance class. You are well into your
career, and Home Depot is on your mind. Perhaps you are a mutual fund manager
trying to decide whether to allocate $25 million of new money to Home Depot stock.
Perhaps you are a major shareholder pondering a sellout. You could be an investment
banker seeking business from Home Depot or a bondholder concerned with Home
Depot’s credit standing. You could be the treasurer or CFO of Home Depot or of
one of its competitors. You want to understand Home Depot’s value and financial
performance. How would you start?
Home Depot’s common stock closed fiscal 2014 at a price of $114.75 per share.
There were 1,307 million shares outstanding, so Home Depot’s market capitalization
or “market cap” was $114.75 × 1,307 = $149,978 million, or nearly $150 billion.
This is a big number, of course, but Home Depot is a big company. Home Depot’s
shareholders have, over the years, invested billions in the company. Therefore,
you decide to compare Home Depot’s market capitalization with the book value of
Home Depot’s equity. The book value measures shareholders’ cumulative investment
in the firm.
You turn to Home Depot’s income statement and balance sheet, which are reproduced
in Tables 4.1 and 4.2.1 At the end of 2014, the book value of Home Depot’s
equity was $9,322 million. Therefore, Home Depot’s market value added, the difference
between the market value of the firm’s shares and the amount of money that
shareholders have invested in the firm, was $149,978 − $9,322 = $140,656 million.
In other words, Home Depot shareholders have contributed about $9.3 billion
and ended up with shares worth almost $150 billion. They have accumulated $140.7
billion in market value added.

The consultancy firm EVA Dimensions calculates market value added for a large
sample of U.S. companies. Table 4.3 shows a few of the firms from EVA’s list. They
include some of the most and least successful companies. Apple heads the group.
It has created $627.6 billion of wealth for its shareholders. Bank of America languishes
near the bottom: The market value of its shares is $118 billion less than the
amount of shareholders’ money invested in the firm.
The top-listed companies in Table 4.3 are large firms. Their managers have lots
of assets to work with. A small firm could not hope to create so much extra value.
Therefore, financial managers and analysts also like to calculate how much value has
been added for each dollar that shareholders have invested. To do this, they compute
the ratio of market value to book value. For example, Home Depot’s market-to-book
ratio in early 2015 (at the end of its 2014 fiscal year) was2

In other words, Home Depot has multiplied the value of its shareholders’ investment
16.1 times.
Table 4.3 shows a sample of market-to-book ratios for 2014. Notice that
Coca-Cola has a much higher market-to-book ratio than ExxonMobil. But Exxon’s
market value added is higher because of its larger scale.
The market-value performance measures in Table 4.3 have three drawbacks. First,
the market value of the company’s shares reflects investors’ expectations about future
performance. Investors pay attention to current profits and investment, of course, but
they also avidly forecast investment and growth. Second, market values fluctuate
because of many risks and events that are outside the financial manager’s control.
Thus, market values are noisy measures of how well the corporation’s management is
performing. Third, you can’t look up the market value of privately owned companies
whose shares are not traded. Nor can you observe the market value of divisions or
plants that are parts of larger companies. You may use market values to satisfy yourself
that Home Depot as a whole has performed well, but you can’t use them to drill
down to compare the performance of the lumber and home improvement divisions.
To do this, you need accounting measures of profitability. We start with economic
value added (EVA).
Economic Value Added and Accounting
Rates of Return
When accountants draw up an income statement, they start with revenues and then
deduct operating and other costs. But one important cost is not included: the cost of
the capital the firm employs. Therefore, to see whether the firm has truly created
value, we need to measure whether it has earned a profit after deducting all costs,
including the cost of its capital.
Recall from Chapters 1 and 2 that the cost of capital is the minimum acceptable rate
of return on capital investment. It is an opportunity cost of capital because it equals the
expected rate of return on opportunities open to investors in financial markets.
The firm creates value only if it can earn more than its cost of capital, that is, more
than its investors can earn by investing on their own.
The profit after deducting all costs, including the cost of capital, is called the
company’s economic value added or EVA. The term “EVA” was coined by Stern
Stewart & Co., which did much to develop and promote the concept. EVA is also
called residual income.
In calculating EVA, it’s customary to take account of all the long-term capital contributed
by investors in the corporation. That means including bonds and other longterm
debt as well as equity capital. Total long-term capital, usually called total
capitalization, is the sum of long-term debt and shareholders’ equity.

of government debt. Greece is a member of the single-currency euro club, so it had no
control over its currency and could not just print more euros to service its debts. In
2011 it defaulted on debts totaling €100 billion.
Greece was still on shaky ground in early 2016, despite a series of rescue packages
from the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary
Fund. Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and other European countries that had also worried
investors avoided default and seemed to be recovering. But unemployment in many
European countries remained stubbornly high and economic growth anemic.
What lessons can you, as a student of finance, draw from these financial crises?
Here are three. First, note the sorry consequences for the economy when financial
markets and institutions do not carry out the functions described in this chapter. For
example, the crisis was amplified by the sudden disappearance of liquidity in many
markets, including the market for MBSs. That meant that potential buyers of the illiquid
assets could not know for sure what they were worth. Thus, the informational function
of financial markets was also compromised.
Second, why were Bear Stearns, Lehman, Merrill Lynch, and the other distressed
firms so fragile? One reason is that they were mostly financed with borrowed money,
much of it short-term debt that had to be refinanced frequently. Investment banks like
Lehman typically were financed with more than 95% debt and less than 5% equity
capital. Thus a 5% fall in their asset values could wipe out their equity “cushions” and
leave the banks insolvent. Regulators since the crisis have therefore required banks to
finance with much more equity. This requirement has also affected payout to shareholders.
A U.S. bank’s dividend payments can be stopped by regulators if the bank’s
equity capital ratio is not up to snuff. We cover decisions about debt versus equity
financing and payout in Chapters 16 and 17.
Third, some causes of the crisis can be traced back to agency problems noted in
Chapter 1. Managers in the mortgage business were probably at least dimly aware that
promoting and selling massive amounts of subprime MBSs was likely to end badly.
They didn’t wake up in the morning thinking, “Hey, maybe I can cause a financial
crisis,” but their incentives did call for trying to squeeze out one more fat bonus before
the game ended. Their incentives were not aligned withMortgage-backed securities (MBSs) provide another example
of how financial markets convey savings to finance
investment in real assets. In this case, the real assets
are homes, which homeowners finance in part with mortgage
loans.
In the old days—the 1960s, for example—most mortgage
loans were made by local banks, savings banks, and savings
and loan institutions (S&Ls), which accepted deposits and savings
accounts and made mortgage and other local loans. We
will use an S&L as the example. The flow of savings would be
as described by the figure in Panel a, at the bottom of this box.
The typical mortgage was long term, up to 30 years maturity,
with a fixed interest rate. The S&Ls’ liabilities—chiefly savings
accounts—had much shorter maturities, perhaps a year
or two on average. The S&Ls were therefore “borrowing
short, lending long,” a dangerous investment strategy. When
interest rates rose in the 1970s and 1980s, the S&Ls’ interest
costs on savings accounts rose, too, but their interest income
was locked up in long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. Losses
mounted. The S&L crisis of the 1980s followed.*
The invention of the MBS allowed S&Ls to eliminate the risks
of borrowing short and lending long. You can still get a mortgage
from your local S&L, but now the S&L does not have to keep it.
The S&L originates the mortgage, but will probably resell it to an
MBS issuer—for example, Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage
Association or FNMA†) or Bank of America. The issuer combines
your mortgage with hundreds or thousands of others and
issues an MBS backed by the combined portfolio. The MBS is
sold to investors such as life insurance companies that want to
hold long-term, fixed-rate obligations. Cash flows from the mortgage
portfolio are passed through to investors.‡
Suppose a life insurance company purchases an MBS. The
flow of savings would now match the figure in Panel b.
Finance in Practice Mortgage-Backed Securities
* For a history of the crisis, see Edward J. Kane, The S&L Insurance Mess: How
Did It Happen? (Washington, D.C.: Urban Institute Press, 1989).
† Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) are
government-sponsored entities (GSEs) charged with increasing the availability
of mortgage credit. The GSEs purchase “conforming loans” and package and
resell them as MBSs. Nonconforming loans—for example, large, “jumbo”
mortgages—are packaged by banks such as Citigroup or Bank of America.
‡ You still send monthly payments to your local S&L. The S&L extracts a small
servicing fee and sends your payments along to the MBS issuer, which also
extracts a small servicing fee. Net cash flows from the portfolio of mortgages
then go to the MBS investors.

Created fromThe financial crisis of 2007–2009 raised many questions, but it settled one question
conclusively: Yes, financial markets and institutions are important. When financial
markets and institutions ceased to operate properly, the world was pushed into a global
recession.
The financial crisis had its roots in the easy-money policies that were pursued by
the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks following the collapse of the Internet
and telecom stock bubble in 2000. At the same time, large balance-of-payments surpluses
in Asian economies were invested back into U.S. debt securities. This also
helped to push down interest rates and contribute to lax credit.
Banks took advantage of this cheap money to expand the supply of subprime mortgages
to low-income borrowers. Many banks tempted would-be homeowners with low
initial payments, offset by significantly higher payments later.18 (Some home buyers
were betting on escalating housing prices so that they could resell or refinance before
the higher payments kicked in.) One lender is even said to have advertised what it
dubbed its “NINJA” loan—NINJA standing for “No Income, No Job, and No Assets.”
Most subprime mortgages were then packaged together into mortgage-backed securities
(MBSs) that could be resold. But, instead of selling these securities to investors
who could best bear the risk, many banks kept large quantities of the loans on their
own books or sold them to other banks.
The widespread availability of mortgage finance fueled a dramatic increase in
house prices, which doubled in the 5 years ending June 2006. At that point, prices
started to slide and homeowners began to default on their mortgages. A year later,
Bear Stearns, a large investment bank, announced huge losses on the mortgage investments
that were held in two of its hedge funds. By the spring of 2008, Bear Stearns
was on the verge of bankruptcy, and the U.S. Federal Reserve arranged for it to be
acquired by JPMorgan Chase.
The crisis peaked in September 2008, when the U.S. government was obliged to take
over the giant federal mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which
had invested several hundred billion dollars in subprime mortgage-backed securities.
Over the next few days, the financial system started to melt down. Both Merrill Lynch
and Lehman Brothers were in danger of failing. On September 14, the government
arranged for Bank of America to take over Merrill in return for financial guarantees.
However, it did nothing to rescue Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy protection
the next day. Two days later, the government reluctantly lent $85 billion to the
giant insurance company AIG, which had insured huge volumes of mortgage-backed
securities and other bonds against default. The following day, the Treasury unveiled its
first proposal to spend $700 billion to purchase “toxic” mortgage-backed securities.
After the failure of Lehman and the forced rescues of Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac, Merrill Lynch, and AIG, investors and financial institutions had to ask, “Who will
be next? Do I dare trade with or lend money to Bank X?” In many situations, the cautious
answer was “No.” Customary day-to-day financial transactions were canceled or completed
on onerous terms.19 At the same time, trading in MBSs and other hard-to-value
securities dried up; it therefore became even harder to know what these securities were
worth. As banks and other financial institutions became reluctant to trade securities or
lend to one another, the supply of credit to the economy contracted and business investment
was cut back. The U.S. economy suffered one of its worst setbacks since the Great
Depression. Unemployment rose rapidly and business bankruptcies tripled.
2.4
18 With a so-called option ARM loan, the minimum mortgage payment was often not even sufficient to cover
that month’s interest on the loan. The unpaid interest was then added to the amount of the mortgage, so the
homeowner was burdened by an ever-increasing mortgage that one day would need to be paid off.
19 The interest rate on interbank loans rose in 2008 to 4.6%Stock prices and company values summarize investors’ collective assessment
of how well a company is doing, both its current performance and its future prospects.
Thus an increase in stock price sends a positive signal from investors to
managers.16 That is why top management’s compensation is linked to stock prices. A
manager who owns shares in his or her company will be motivated to increase the
company’s market value. This reduces agency costs by aligning the interests of managers
and stockholders.
This is one important advantage of going public. A private company can’t use its
stock price as a measure of performance. It can still compensate managers with shares,
but the shares will not be valued in a financial market.
Cost of Capital Financial managers look to financial markets to measure, or at
least estimate, the cost of capital for the firm’s investment projects. The cost of capital
is the minimum acceptable rate of return on the project. Investment projects offering
rates of return higher than their cost of capital are worthwhile because they add value;
they make both the firm and its shareholders better off financially. Projects offering
rates of return less than the cost of capital subtract value and should not be
undertaken.17
Thus the hurdle rate for investments inside the corporation is actually set outside
the corporation. The expected rate of return on investments in financial markets determines
the opportunity cost of capital.
The opportunity cost of capital is generally not the interest rate that the firm pays on
a loan from a bank or insurance company. If the company is making a risky investment,
the opportunity cost of capital is the expected rate of return that investors can
achieve in financial markets at the same level of risk. The expected rate of return on
risky securities is normally well above the interest rate on corporate borrowing.
We introduced the cost of capital in Chapter 1, but this brief reminder may help to
fix the idea. We cover the cost of capital in detail in Chapters 11 and 12.

16 We can’t claim that investors’ assessments of value are always correct. Finance can be a risky and dangerous
business—dangerous for your wealth, that is. With hindsight we see horrible mistakes by investors, for example,
the gross overvaluation of Internet and telecom companies in 2000. On average, however, it appears that financial
markets collect and assess information quickly and accurately. We’ll discuss this issue again in Chapter 7.
17 Of course, the firm may invest for other reasons. For example, it may invest in pollution control equipment for
a factory. The equipment may not generate a cash return but may still be worth investing in to meet legal and
ethical obligations.

Created fromand firms to send and receive payments quickly and safely over long distances. Banks
are the obvious providers of payment services, but they are not alone. For example, if
you buy shares in a money market mutual fund, your money is pooled with that of
other investors and used to buy safe, short-term securities. You can then write checks
on this mutual fund investment, just as if you had a bank deposit.
Information Provided by Financial Markets
In well-functioning financial markets, you can see what securities and commodities are
worth, and you can see—or at least estimate—the rates of return that investors can expect
on their savings. The information provided by financial markets is often essential to a
financial manager’s job. Here are three examples of how this information can be used.
Commodity Prices Catalytic converters are used in the exhaust systems of cars and
light trucks to reduce pollution. The catalysts include platinum, which is traded on the
New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
In March a manufacturer of catalytic converters is planning production for October.
How much per ounce should the company budget for purchases of platinum in that
month? Easy: The company’s CFO looks up the futures price of platinum on the New
York Mercantile Exchange—$972 per ounce for delivery in October (this was the
closing price for platinum in March 2016, for delivery in October). The CFO can lock
in that price if she wishes. The details of such a trade are covered in Chapter 24.
Interest Rates The CFO of Catalytic Concepts has to raise $400 million in new
financing. She considers an issue of long-term bonds. What will the interest rate on the
bonds be? To find out, the CFO looks up interest rates on existing bonds traded in
financial markets.
The results are shown in Table 2.2. Notice how the interest rate climbs as credit
quality deteriorates: The largest, safest companies, which are rated AAA (“triple-A”),
can raise long-term debt at a 2.59% interest rate. The interest rates for AA, A, and
BBB rise to 2.62%, 3.03%, and 4.32%, respectively. BBB companies are still regarded
as investment grade, that is, good quality, but the next step down takes the investor into
junk bond territory. The interest rate for BB debt climbs to 5.62%. Single-B companies
are riskier still, so investors demand 8.32%.
There will be more on bond ratings and interest rates in Chapter 6. But you can see
how a financial manager can use information from fixed-income markets to forecast
the interest rate on new debt financing. For example, if Catalytic Concepts can qualify
as a BBB-rated company, and interest rates are as shown in Table 2.2, it should be able
to raise new debt financing for approximately 4.32%.
Company Values How much was Callaway Golf worth in March 2016? How about
Alaska Air Group, Entergy, Yum! Brands, or GE? Table 2.3 shows the market capitalization
of each company. We simply multiply the number of shares outstanding by the
price per share in the stock market. Investors valued Callaway Golf at $821 million
and GE at $283 billion.
TABLE 2.2 Interest rates on
long-term corporate bonds,
March 2016. The interest rate is
lowest for top-quality (AAA)
issuers. The rate rises as credit
quality declines.
Credit Rating Interest RateLiquidity
Markets and intermediaries also provide liquidity, that is, the ability to turn an investment
back into cash when needed. Suppose you deposit $5,000 in a savings bank on
February 1. During that month, the bank uses your deposit and other new deposits to
make a 6-month construction loan to a real estate developer. On March 1, you realize
that you need your $5,000 back. The bank can give it to you. Because the bank has
thousands of depositors, and other sources of financing if necessary, it can make an
illiquid loan to the developer financed by liquid deposits made by you and other customers.
If you lend your money for 6 months directly to the real estate developer, you
will have a hard time retrieving it 1 month later.15
The shares of public companies are liquid because they are traded more or less continuously
in the stock market. An Italian investor who puts $60,000 into Bank of
America shares can recover that money on short notice. (A $60,000 sell order is a drop
in the bucket compared with the normal trading volume of Bank of America shares.)
Mutual funds can r
