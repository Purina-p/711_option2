For example, you can buy an option to purchase IBM shares at a fixed price on a 
fixed future date. The option’s payoff depends on the price of IBM shares on that 
date. Commodities can be traded by a different kind of derivative security called a 
futures contract.

Trump contracts declined. But as it became clear that Trump 
was headed toward a big victory in the New York primary in 
April, the price of Trump contracts dramatically recovered.
The red line in the figure is for “Rest of field” (i.e., a contract that will pay off $1 if anyone other than the named candidates in the figure wins the nomination). The 20 cent price for 
this contract in early April is evidence that even at this late 
date, there was meaningful uncertainty about the prospects 
for a contested convention in which someone other than the 
current leaders would be selected as the Republican candidate. By May, however, Trump futures were selling for $.92, 
and the "Rest of field" price had fallen to $.06.
Participants in prediction markets are putting their money 
where their mouth is. So the forecasting accuracy of these 
markets compares favorably with that of major polls. Some 
businesses have formed internal prediction markets to survey 
the views of their staff. For example, Google operates an 
internal market to forecast product launch dates, the number 
of Gmail users, and other strategic questions.*
* Google’s experience is analyzed in B. Cowgill, J. Wolfers, and E. Zitzewitz, 
“Using Prediction Markets to Track Information Flows: Evidence from Google,” 
working paper, Dartmouth College, January 2009.
Stock markets allow investors to bet on their favorite stocks. 
Prediction markets allow them to bet on almost anything else. 
These markets reveal the collective guess of traders on 
issues as diverse as New York City snowfall, an avian flu outbreak, and the occurrence of a major earthquake.
Prediction markets are conducted on a number of online 
exchanges such as PredictIt (www.predictit.org) and Iowa Electronic Markets (tippie.uiowa.edu/iem). Take the 2016 presidential primaries as an example. On the Iowa Electronic Markets 
you could have bet that Donald Trump would win the Republican nomination by buying one of his contracts. Each Trump 
contract promised to pay $1 if he won the nomination and nothing if he lost. If you thought that the probability of a Trump victory was 55% (say), you would have been prepared to pay up to 
$.55 for his contract. Someone who was relatively pessimistic 
about Trump’s chances would have been happy to sell you 
such a contract because that sale would turn a profit if he were 
to lose. With many participants buying and selling, the market 
price of a contract revealed the collective wisdom of the crowd.
Take a look at the accompanying figure from the Iowa 
Electronic Markets. It shows the contract prices for the various 
contenders for the Republican nomination between January 
and May 2016. You can see that as Ted Cruz beat Trump in a 
series of primaries and caucuses during March, the price of

Commodity and derivative markets are not sources of financing but markets where 
the financial manager can adjust the firm’s exposure to business risks. For example, an 
electric generating company may wish to lock in the future price of natural gas
