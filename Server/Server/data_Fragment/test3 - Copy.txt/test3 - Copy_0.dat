funds, hedge funds also pool the savings of different investors and 
invest on their behalf. But they differ from mutual funds in at least two ways. First, 
because hedge funds usually follow complex, high-risk investment strategies, access is 
usually restricted to knowledgeable investors such as pension funds, endowment funds, 
and wealthy individuals. Don’t try to send a check for $3,000 or $5,000 to a hedge 
fund; most hedge funds are not in the “retail” investment business. Second, hedge 
funds try to attract the most talented managers by compensating them with potentially 
lucrative, performance-related fees.4
 In contrast, mutual funds usually charge a fixed 
percentage of assets under management.
Hedge funds follow many different investment strategies. Some try to make a profit 
by identifying overvalued stocks or markets and selling short. (We will not go into 
procedures for short-selling here. Just remember that short-sellers profit when prices 
fall.5
) “Vulture funds” specialize in the securities of distressed corporations. Some 
hedge funds take bets on firms involved in merger negotiations, others look for mispriced convertible bonds, and some take positions in currencies and interest rates. 
Hedge funds manage less money than mutual funds, but they sometimes take very big 
positions and have a large impact on the market.
There are other ways of pooling and investing savings. Consider a pension plan set 
up by a corporation or other organization on behalf of its employees. There are several 
types of pension plan. The most common type of plan is the defined-contribution plan. 
In this case, a percentage of the employee’s monthly paycheck is contributed to a 
pension fund. (The employer and employee may each contribute 5%, for example.) 
Contributions from all participating employees are pooled and invested in securities or 
mutual funds. (Usually the employees can choose from a menu of funds with different 
investment strategies.) Each employee’s balance in the plan grows over the years as 
contributions continue and investment income accumulates. The balance in the plan 
can be used to finance living expenses after retirement. The amount available for 
retirement depends on the accumulated contributions and on the rate of return earned 
on the investments.6
Pension funds are designed for long-run investment. They provide professional 
management and diversification. They also have an important tax advantage: Contributions are tax-deductible, and investment returns inside the plan are not taxed until 
cash is finally withdrawn.7
Pension plans are among the most important vehicles for savings. Total assets held 
by U.S. pension plans were about $15 trillion in 2015
