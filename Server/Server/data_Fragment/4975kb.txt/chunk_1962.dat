The IFR executive summary for 2019 projects that China alone
will account for about 48% of the top 10 market, with a market
almost double that in 2016. Furthermore, the four East Asian
countries of China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan will constitute
approximately 75% of the market. These numbers confirm that
a robotics revolution is already taking place in East Asia, and
soon this revolution is expected to spill over to the U.S. and thus
a skilled workforce must be prepared to handle the upcoming
“Tsunami” of skill need.
Furthermore, in 2016, for the first time, the electronics industry
exceeded the automotive industry in demand for industrial
robotics in the Asian markets of China, Japan, and Korea.
Worldwide, the electronics sector’s share of the robotics market
rose steadily to 32% in 2017, almost equal to the automotive
sector (33%) [8]. This ratio is quickly changing, and the
electronics and metal industries are quickly becoming dominant
robotic markets. This change indicates that sectors that have
not been historical markets for industrial robotics, are now
adapting to this robotics revolution, which adds even more
pressure on the need for skilled technicians.
Furthermore, the IFR expects that the total number of industrial
robots in 2020 will be double the number in 2014. This change
in technology requires “targeted training and further education
for employees” [9]. Moreover, the IFR forecasts that intelligent
robots will take the lead in the robotics industry in the upcoming
years [10].
