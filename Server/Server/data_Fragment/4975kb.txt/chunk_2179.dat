cutting edge AI technologies were deployed in self-driving
vehicles, advanced autopilots, and in surgical robots, in addition
to the military applications. Industrial robotics witnessed a
slower advance of artificial intelligence when compared to the
medical and military fields. When artificial intelligence is
coupled with industrial Robotics, the new technology is referred
to as “Intelligent Industrial Robotics”.
Figure 1 shows the relationship between industrial robotics and
artificial intelligence [11]. Next Generation Intelligent
Industrial Robotics have an advanced computing capability
coupled with an advanced sensing and perception system,
which allows them to self-learn and work in a free mobile
environment.

and highly-controlled environments, and do not have the ability to selflearn.
Although intelligent robotics have been used in medical and
military applications, they however, have only recently started
penetrating industrial applications. This is mainly because for a
technology to be used on an industrial level, it has to have
established and standardized protocols for corrective and
predictive maintenance, and trained technicians that are widely
available with established training programs. The introduction
of the new technology of intelligent robotics means
manufacturers will need technicians that are trained to handle
the new change in technology.
There are two primary advantages of deploying the nextgeneration intelligent industrial robotics, in place of the current
generation of robots:
- The ability of intelligent robotics to self-learn: The
Intelligent robots can self-learn the optimal process
and solve problems. For example, an intelligent robot
can self-learn to twist itself for the best grip of a part,
and the part infront of it does not have to be in an exact
orientation to be handled by the robot. This is contrast
to the current-generation robotics which cannot selflearn, and any slight change in the orientation of the
part to be picked, can cause the robot to jam and cause
a production line to stop. The improvement in the
process after the machine self-learns can be as much
as a “million fold” [10].
- The mobility, free movement, and ability to
collaborate: the high flexibility achieved from
intelligent robotics improves productivity and safety
significantly. The current generation of industrial
robots are isolated in cages, and only operate in highlycontrolled and deterministic environments for safety
[12] [13]. As a result, the National Institute of
Standards predicts that intelligent robotics can save
manufacturers at l
