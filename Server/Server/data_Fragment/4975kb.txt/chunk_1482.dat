kPa. Fig.17 shows the results of
examining the response to a triangular wave with 25%
symmetry. When the peak current value was 0.2A, the
pressure change corresponding to the input current was
18.4kPa. Both the input rectangular wave with a duty ratio of
25% and the triangular wave with a symmetry of 25%
basically showed a response like a first-order lag system. On
the other hand, overshoot was observed in the area where the
current value suddenly decreased. After the overshoot, the
pressure gradually decreased. The characteristic of overshoot
has regularity that does not depend on the type of waveform.

â€¢ Response to artificial beat
The following two features were paid attention from the
results of examining the difference between the type and the
ratio of the waveform. The One is the characteristic of a
square wave that was stable after the response asymptotically
approached a constant value. The other is the characteristic
of a triangular wave where the responses rise process was
rapid. An attempt was made to reproduce a pulse
corresponding to the heart beat by creating an arbitrary
waveform that combines the above two characteristics. The
results are shown in Fig.18. The results in Fig. 18 confirm 4001

the characteristics of the first-order lag system and the
overshoot at the end of the response.

C. Considerations
Features of the first-order lag system appeared
remarkably in all experimental results. The cause is
considered to be the characteristic of the pump and the water
