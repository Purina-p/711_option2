segment. Figure 1 shows some of the most important elements
(concepts, individuals and relations) of the instances from
SSN ontology, generated in this scenario. As we can see in
this view, the sensing devices observes the Car_flow property,
producing sensor outputs, with different values.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The principal advantage of this approach is that allows
to maximize the intelligence of ITS through the semantic
annotation of the data collected by the sensors to be
understood by the applications involved on ITS. However,
the process of mapping the sensor data to semantic
knowledge is too difficult and still needs some human
participation. Thus, as future work, we are planning the
design of the rule based system to improve the mapping
process, reducing the human intervention in the semantic
annotation.
