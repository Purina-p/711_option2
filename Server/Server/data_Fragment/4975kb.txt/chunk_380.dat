than expected. Accenture reports that, in a survey, 84% of
manufacturing executives indicated that the workforce is
unprepared to adopt Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) [24]
[25] [26] [27]. IIoT is just one aspect of intelligent industrial
robotics. Dr. Inaba of Fanuc Robotics, the world’s largest robot
manufacturer, states that to overcome competitiveness due to
labor cost, manufacturers “robotize and put in IT (Interner of
Things) function” [22]. This is yet another indicator for the
need for only highly-skilled labor who are trained to handle
robotics with IoT and artificial intelligence, as manufacturers
eventually will have to robotize in order to stay competitive.

From the above discussion, all data evidence suggests that there
will exist a profound need for technicians and engineers that are
trained to handle intelligent industrial robots in the upcoming
years. The lack of trained technicians can significantly slow
down manufacturers from adopting intelligent robot
technologies, and as a result reduce their overall
competitiveness and production. A workforce pool should be
created soon to handle the quickly advancing adoption and
utilization of intelligent industrial robotics.
V. CONCLUSION
In this work we show the current and future forecast of the
industry drive in the field of industrial robotics. Current data
show that there is a revolution of industrial robotics taking place
in the world, and particularly in East Asia. Current studies
show significant positive impact that resulted from deploying
the next-generation industrial robotic, which are characterized
by the use of artificial intelligence, the main feature of Industry
4.0. The shift from current-generation to the next-generation
industrial robotics is a shift from Automation to Collaboration.
Some of the challenges associated with the shift to nextgeneration industrial robotics, include a severe need for a
trained workforce that can handle these technologies.
