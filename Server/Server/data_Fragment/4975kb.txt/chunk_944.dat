shifting angle () is measured by the potentiometer attached
and as it can change from stationary position  to holding
position 	. Once the ball holding is completely achieved
 
 	 as shown in the Fig. 4, rotation of the wheel is
determined to control the motion of the ball synchronizing with
robotâ€™s movements. To prevent unnecessary rotations of the ball
during the dribbling, two additional omni-wheels have been
mounted right below the wheel arms. Hence, the proposed
structure with four wheels enable the robot to touch the ball at
four contact points. This ensures proper ball handling and
holding without l
