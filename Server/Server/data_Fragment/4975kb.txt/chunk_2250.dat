indicate the number of coefficients used in each training vector.
As mentioned before, the continuous HMM with HTK could
not be trained with the real-time corpus recorded since the program
did not find enough sequences of observations in the samples. For
that reason the general table of results is expressed as follows in
Table 6.
Once the results showed in table 5 and 6 have been obtained, a
comparison has been made with other works in the state of the art.
Considering the highest percentage obtained in the present work
for an out-of-real-time transcriber and real-time AMT.
