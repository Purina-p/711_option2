oboCup Middle Sized League (MSL) robot
soccer. To promote intelligent robots, MSL rules are annually
reviewed and updated. In recent years, not only the robot
behaviors as a team, but also different ball passing methods for
various situations are being required to achieve high score.
Hibikino-Musashi has achieved seven consecutive victories in
Japanese competition. However to give a better competition
with the other teams in the competition, robot’s mobile velocity
and ball retention has a significant impact in planning the action
of the robot. Upgraded version of the soccer robot “HibikinoMusashi” shown in Fig. 1 is having the robot’s mobile velocity
improvement by 40% of its old design and introduced a ball
retention capability [2]. This paper discusses the mathematical
modelling of the ball handling mechanism using the geometrical
properties of the proposed system architecture and the robot’s
velocity. Main consideration goes to achieve a proper motion
control of the ball during the dribbling. As a geometrical concept
based model is proposed in this paper, it does not need any precalibration of the system in case of setting control parameter is
one of the major advantage of this method. Furthermore, when
holding the robot ball in mid-size League, robot is allowed to
touch a range of one-third of the ball (hereinafter ball holding
area) during dribbling the ball must be rotated spontaneously on
the relative traveling direction of the robot [3]. By considering
all the rules and regulations we have put our effort to develop a
feasible model for handling the ball.
Fig. 1 shows the overview of the soccer robot of “HibikinoMusashi” developed by our team of Kyushu Institute of
Technology, Japan. The mechanical structure of the ball
handling mechanism is shown in the figure is developed based
on the derived mathematical model proposed in this paper.

II. DEVELOPMENT OF BALL HANDLING MECHANISM
Several different ball retaining mechanisms for soccer robot
have been reported in literature [4]-[7]. One type of ball holding
and control mechanism by using two wheels mounted in the
front of the robot and another type is a ball retaining mechanism
using arms. With the rule amendments, ball control by two
wheels in front of a robot has become the mainstream. The
advantage of ball holding mechanism using wheels is the
capability of holding the ball even in lateral and reverse motions
of the robot.
One of the major disadvantages of this approach is the
complexity and the difficulty to dribble. It is essential to
maintain a natural ball rotation with respect to the traveling
direction of the robot. Moreover ball handling is restricted to the
ball holding area.
 Mechanical structural design of the ball handling
mechanism is given Fig. 2. The operation range of the ball
handling mechanism is restricted to the ball handling area as
defined in the rules and regulations of the RoboCup competition.
A. Proposed Ball Handling and Holding Mechanism
In the proposed ball handling mechanism active wheels are
attached to the lever tips to dribble the ball by the rotating of the
wheels. Lever moves passively upward as lever wheels rotate to
hold the ball. Omni wheel mounted below the levers of the ball
handling mechanism is to prevent the ball contact with the robot
body. Omni wheels are free to rotate passively as the ball rotates.
When the robot detects the approaching of the ball, wheels
on the two levers start to rotate to bring the ball inside the robot.
As shown in the Fig. 3, ball starts to rotate with the wheel and
moves inside the robot. Lever with the wheel moves upward as
the ball is drawn inside the robot.
To recognize the ball retrieving and holding situations, lever
