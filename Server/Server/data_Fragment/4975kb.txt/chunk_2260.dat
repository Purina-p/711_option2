flowing through the tube that was pumped up by the
diaphragm pump in a certain cycle also stops suddenly.
However, in reality, the water flowing through the tube does
not stop suddenly, inertial force exert the fluid, and the
pressure increases when the flow rate increases at the
moment the motor stops driving. The overshoot shown at
the end of the response is considered the above pressure
increase. In other words, if a train running at a constant
speed suddenly stops, passengers will feel acceleration in
the direction of travel and stagger. It is thought that the cause
of the overshoot is that a similar phenomenon occurs in the
water flowing through the pipe.
IV. CONCLUSION
The purpose of this study was to construct a model of a blood
vessel that artificially generated beat . The constructed artificial
beating blood vessel model was found to be a first-order lag
system from the experimental results. By changing the function
waveform output from the function generator was changed, the
characteristics of the response of each waveform was confirmed.
However, when the frequency was increased to 1 Hz according
to the heartbeat, it could not follow and match. In addition, we
tried to reproduce the pulse corresponding to the heartbeat by
creating an arbitrary waveform that combines the waveforms,
but the accuracy of the pulse corresponding to the heartbeat was
not improved, and the problem remained. The following two
points need to be improved to solve the problem. The first is to
consider ways to counteract overshoots by inertial force, which
is considered to be the characteristic of the motor. The other is
to consider the effects of fluid [6] that was not considered in this
experiment. Therefore, further improvement of the artificial
beating blood vessel model and its incorporation into a medical
phantom are future prospects.
