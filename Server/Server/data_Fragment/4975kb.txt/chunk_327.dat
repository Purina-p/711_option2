types of robots which are classified as “Service Robots”.
In March 2018, the Chinese president Xi Jinping stated that
China places its push towards “intelligent robotics” as a priority
for its growth [3]. In January of that year, the Chinese state
started a national campaign for its new industrial policy “Made
in China 2025”, which promotes intelligent robotics and a robot
revolution in Chinese manufacturing plants to “turbocharge” its
economy [4] [5]. As a result, a robotics revolution is currently
taking place in China, and East Asia in general, as evidenced by
the statistical data gathered by the International Federation of
Robotics (IFR) (see Table 1 and Table 2).

Table 2. Projected Market Size of Industrial Robotics by the end
of 2019 [8]
According to the 2016 report of the International Federation of
Robotics (IFR), the market size of the top three countries China,
Korea, and Japan constitutes 68% , that is more than twice the
market size of the next seven countries combined (32%
including the U.S.). Table 1 lists the top 10 countries in growth
of industrial robotics for the year 2016.
