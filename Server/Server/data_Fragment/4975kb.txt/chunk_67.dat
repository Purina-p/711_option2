flowing through the tube that was pumped up by the
diaphragm pump in a certain cycle also stops suddenly.
However, in reality, the water flowing through the tube does
not stop suddenly, inertial force exert the fluid, and the
pressure increases when the flow rate increases at the
moment the motor stops driving. The overshoot shown at
the end of the response is considered the above pressure
increase. In other words, if a train running at a constant
speed suddenly stops, passengers will feel acceleration in
the direction of travel and stagger. It is thought that the cause
of the overshoot is that a similar phenomenon occurs in the
water flowing through the pipe.
IV. CONCLUSION
The purpose of this study was to construct a model of a blood
vessel that artificially generated beat . The constructed artificial
beating blood vessel model was found to be a first-order lag
system from the experimental results. By changing the function
waveform output from the function generator was changed, the
characteristics of the response of each waveform was confirmed.
However, when the frequency was increased to 1 Hz according
to the heartbeat, it could not follow and match. In addition, we
tried to reproduce the pulse corresponding to the heartbeat by
creating an arbitrary waveform that combines the waveforms,
but the accuracy of the pulse corresponding to the heartbeat was
not improved, and the problem remained. The following two
points need to be improved to solve the problem. The first is to
consider ways to counteract overshoots by inertial force, which
is considered to be the characteristic of the motor. The other is
to consider the effects of fluid [6] that was not considered in this
experiment. Therefore, further improvement of the artificial
beating blood vessel model and its incorporation into a medical
phantom are future prospects.

Abstract—In this paper we present recent advances, current
and future market trends in industrial robotics. Artificial
Intelligence has evolved as the main feature to characterize
Industry 4.0, Next-generation robotics utilize this feature to
perform tasks collaboratively, as opposed to the currently
deployed industrial robots, which were designed mainly for
automation, isolated in cages, and highly-controlled
environments. Current data show that China takes the lead
in the industrial robotics market with 48% of the top-ten
market in 2019. The electronics sector took the lead in
robot-deployment in East Asia, and is continuously
increasing in deploying industrial robotics in other parts of
the world. Studies on the challenges associated with this
technology, show that the main concern is the lack of
trained labor to handle the technologies in next generation
industrial robotics.

I. INTRODUCTION
The next-generation industrial robotics have unique features
over the current-generation robotics in the advanced sensory
and perception, and control algorithms, as well as an enhanced
data processing capability [1]. In this work, we investigate
the future direction and advances in the field of industrial
robotics in the age of the fourth generation of industry,
and highlights both merits and limitations associated with
it. It is worth mentioning that the definition of a robot is still
very broad, Joe Engelberger, regarded by many as the “father
