â€¢ Difference in response due to waveform type and ratio
Fig.15 shows the results of examining the response to a
sine wave. When the peak current value was 0.2A, the
pressure change corresponding to the input current was
19.0kPa. Fig.16 shows the results of examining the response
to a rectangular wave with a duty ratio of 25%. When the
input current was 0.2A, the pressure change corresponding
to the input current was 17.7
