Abstract— RoboCup is a platform designed to promote the
fields such as Artificial Intelligent (AI) and robotics for
researchers. As a team “Hibikino-Musashi” participating for
RoboCup Middle-Size League soccer competition, we
continuously upgrade the technology of our robots. In this paper,
motion analysis and control of the ball operation at the time of ball
dribbling is discussed. A ball handling mechanism is proposed
based on the geometrical information of the robot and analysis is
given in detail. A mathematical explanation of the control system
is provided along with simulation studies performed in MATAB
environment. Results have been evaluated to demonstrate the
capability of controlling the motion of the ball and expected
control could be achieved without prior calibration of the ball
handling mechanism.
Keywords—RoboCup; ball handling mechanism
I. INTRODUCTION
Main purpose of RoboCup is to promote artificial
intelligence and robotics. Among the international landmark
projects, RoboCup is with ultimate goal "to create a team of
soccer robots that can compete and win against the human World
Cup champion team by 2050." It encourages researchers to
develop and promote Artificial Intelligence and robotics from
different aspects. Soccer robot is a fully autonomous mobile
vehicle that can perform in a dynamic environment of RoboCup.
New technologies from the mobile robot development are
expected to successfully play a role in the field of human-robot
work partnerships and service markets in the future [1].
Hibikino-Musashi is one of the teams that have been
