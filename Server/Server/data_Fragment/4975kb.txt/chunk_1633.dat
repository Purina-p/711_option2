III. SIMULATION STUDY AND RESULT ANALYSIS
Simulation study was carried in MATLAB environment
using the derived model and results were analyzed. In this study
the velocity of the ball 

  was set to be equal to the robot‚Äôs
velocity 

  . The variations of the angular velocities of the left
and right wheels "
( and "
(), respectively were examined in
order to achieve the above condition under linear motion of the
robot. For this simulation study the target velocity direction $
of the ball was changed from 0¬∫ to 360¬∫ and the magnitude was
changed from 0.5 m/s to 3.5 m/s by 0.5 m/s step. A simple
schematic diagram of the simulation model is given in Fig. 10.
As the robot moves at different speed in different directions, ball
has to be maintained to follow the robot‚Äôs speed and the direction
by means of the driven wheels as shown in Fig. 11. Also, this
simulation validate the Mathematical model. Therefore,
influence of the friction and slip are not considered.
The variation of the :
;< with the variation of 

  was
explained in Fig. 12. As it is expected the angular velocity was a
constant value for any angles for each case of ball velocities. As
the ball velocity is increases, the magnitude of the angular
velocity increases but remaining at the same value as the angle
is changed.
But the ball angular velocity :
;=on the inclined surface was
varied as expected. As the angle of the ball velocity >

; changes,
the amplitude as well as the direction of the :
;=changes as
shown in Fig. 13. Magnitude of the angular velocity becomes
maximum as the robot moves left and right directions and
becomes minimum for forward and backward motions. The
corresponding angles for right motion, forward motion, left
motion and backward motion are 0¬∫, 90 ¬∫, 180 ¬∫ and 270 ¬∫.
Variation of the wheel angular velocity for the corresponding
robot‚Äôs velocities and directions is shown in Fig. 14. As shown
in the figure, when the robot moves forward direction at any
speed, velocities of both the wheels have become equal as
expected. Similarly, when the robot moves either in left side or
right side velocities of the wheels are opposite but with same
magnitude.

IV. CONCLUSION
This paper described the modelling of a ball handling and
retention mechanism for the robot of ‚ÄúHibikino-Musashi‚Äù. The
proposed ball handling mechanism that is used for the dribbling
has been developed and installed on the new robot called
"Musashi150". Ball controlling kinematics model is derived so
that it controls the motion of the ball following the robot‚Äôs

natural direction as the direction of the ball rotation during the
dribbling. Simulation experiments were performed to evaluate
to performances of the proposed mechanism in MATLAB
environment. As a result, simulation shows the expected
variation of the angular velocities of the driven wheels for
different ball velocity directions.
During the back-and-forth (270¬∫ and 90¬∫) movements of the
robot in a real environment, the left and right wheel angular
velocity vectors of the ball handling mechanism should have to
be same, and were able to prove by the simulations. Further,
during the left and right horizontal motions (180¬∫ and 0¬∫),
opposite angular velocities but with same amplitudes of the left
and right wheels could be obtained in the simulations as
expected. To conclude, the proposed model of the ball handling
mechanism for the RoboCup soccer robot has shown the
expected characteristics and verified through the simulation
experiments. To realize the behavior of the proposed mechanism
and control system, experiments will be carried out with real
robot.
