accumulates over time, and the tube is filled with water to
expand. Therefore, it is considered that the process until the
tube expands appears to be the first-order lag system.
From the response to the type and ratio of the waveform
in addition to the artificial beating, it was confirmed that
when various drive waveforms were input as current, the
pressure change occurred according to the current flow.
Therefore, it can be said that a pulse-like response can be
obtained by controlling the current. However, the
characteristic of this system is a first-order lag system with
a time constant of 1.3 s, so the drive cycle could not follow
the same 1 Hz as the heart.
The overshoot appearing at the end of the response
observed in all experiments other than the response to the
step input is considered to be caused by the part after the
motor. In this experiment, the motor used to drive the
diaphragm pump stops driving when the current value falls
below a certain current value even if it does not reach 0A.
After operating with the rated current set to the maximum
value, when the motor speed gradually decreases with a very
gradual input current, the motor stops suddenly without
decelerating. When the motor suddenly stops, the water
