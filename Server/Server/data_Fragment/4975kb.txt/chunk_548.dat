ocation and if selected objects are correct or not.
In addition to that, it can be used when communication channels
are limited such as when wearing gloves limits use of the
teaching pendant, or when physical barriers exist. Thus
complete human-robot communication, and controllability can
be performed at the network level without having to be in the
field with the robot [16] [17]. This capability also allows for
cooperative interface between humans and robots rather than
performing tasks independently. Studies show that cooperative
work is the most optimized form for production when compared
to processes in which humans and robots work independently.
The Industrial Internet of Things Platforms and Wireless
Communication Capability: the Internet of Things
technology is probably the most prominent technology in the
current manufacturing era with the annual spending on IoT
expected to climax at $450 billion in 2023 [18]. Connectivity
of intelligent robots is essential for an optimal utilization of
their functionalities. The well-known robotics manufacturer
