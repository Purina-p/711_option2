respectively. However, it is important to mention when
applying HMM of continuous density, these do not
contemplate as necessary the calculation of F0, which
represents a great advantage since it saves the
implementation and execution of the algorithm for its
detection.
On the other hand, when analyzing Table 6 and
comparing it with Table 5 it is possible to note that the
ANNs increase their precision for this experiment performed
on the corpus recorded in real-time. On the contrary, the VQ
and the GMM decrease in precision.
In this work an algorithm was proposed for an out-ofreal-time AMT. This algorithm works to determine essential
information required by the MIDI format to perform the
transcription; Such as pitch and note length.
The algorithm was applied using Vector Quantification
as classifier and vectors with 12 MFCC coefficients plus F0
as characteristics. The reason for choosing these techniques
is that they provided higher results in comparison to others in
the first stage of the experiment and were also more feasible
to implement in time and form.
The implementation of the algorithm was carried out for
four melodies. It was possible to obtain 100% recognition in
some of them, however a decrease in the performance of the
algorithm could also be observed when they were varied
some of its parameters or criteria.
From the algorithm for an out-of-real-time AMT, an
algorithm for a real-time AMT was proposed modifying
some parts of the previous procedure. This algorithm was
also applied using Vector Quantification as classifier and
vectors with 12 MFCC coefficients plus F0 as
characteristics. On this occasion the implementation of the
algorithm was carried out only on two of the four melodies
transcribed above, but this time these melodies were
recorded in real time. The maximum percentage of
recognition that was obtained for this transcriber was of
76.08%.

I. INTRODUCTION
Since one of the most important information sources in
ITS is sensors, the integration and sharing the sensor data
become a big challenging problem in the application of sensor
networks to these systems.
In order to make full use of the sensor data, is crucial to
convert that sensor data into semantic data, which can be
understood by computers.
In this work, we propose to use the SSN ontology to
manage the sensor information in an intelligent transportation
architecture. The system performs the automatic traffic light
settings allowing to predict and avoid traffic accidents and the
routing optimization.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the
related work in the use of ontologies on ITS. Section III
describes the process of mapping the sensor data to semantic
knowledge in SSN ontology. In section IV the use case of the
traffic light setting system is showed. Finally, the conclusions
and lines of future work are summarized in section V.
II. RELATED WORK
There have been some studies focused on transform the
sensor data into RDF for applications in different fields. Most
of them have emerged in the field of linked sensor data, such
as Esk Hydrological sensor network [1] and SENSEI [2],
which focused on the transformation of the sensor data to
linked sensor. The study of the semantic sensor network has
been also applied in other research fields, for example, the
semantic medical monitoring system model [3] based. These
studies proposed different approaches to transform sensor data
to RDF [4].
Most of the works mentioned above focused on mapping
the sensor data to an existing ontology using a mapping
language such as D2RQ [13], R2RML [5], among others.
RML [6] is an extension of R2RML and was designed as a
general mapping language for heterogeneous data. Although
these kinds of mapping languages are general for different
data sources and different ontologies, the principal limitation
is that they are not especially designed for the sensor data.
III. MAPPING SENSOR DATA TO SSN ONTOLOGY
A. The SSN ontology
The Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology [7] was
developed by the Semantic Sensor Networks Incubator Group
belonging to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The
ontology can model sensor devices, systems, processes,
observations and knowledge of the environment.
B. The mapping method
In this work we used a similar procedure as described in
[8]. They proposed a method to map sensor data to SSN
ontology, translating the sensor data in databases into the RDF
which conforming to SSN ontology. The main steps to
generate RDF are:
• Extract the information of the sensor data from data
sources, and annotate the sensor data using a mapping
schema.
• Creating the mapping file which includes the labeling
information of the data sources and the sensor data.
• Converting the data in database to RDF
automatically.
IV. THE AUTOMATIC TRAFFIC LIGHT SETTINGS
APPLICATION
This scenario is related to the traffic light adjustment,
taking into account the traffic flow and the weather conditions.
The description of the whole traffic scenario is provided by
the traffic ontology, while the information concerning the
sensors is provided by the SSN ontology. The different agents
obtain the knowledge from the ontologies through SPARQL
queries.
