III. CHARACTERISTIC TECHNOLOGIES OF THE NEXTGENERATION INTELLIGENT INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS:
Artificial Intelligence: the methods employed here primarily
rely on algorithms based on neural networks. They can simplify
troubleshooting processes and reduce costs significantly for
manufacturers. Some sensory systems include optical scanners
ad vision systems with the proper image processing algorithms
[14] [15]. Industrial robotics that have the machine learning
and advanced perception capability have been already deployed
in industry as Collaborative robots. Compared to traditional
industrial robots, Co-bots are more dynamic and compact in
size, and equipped with an advanced computing capability
coupled with an advanced sensing and perception system to
sense human presence around them. Ground studies conducted
at Toyota, Ford, and Mercedes Benz indicate that deploying cobots resulted in increased production [2]. The IFR forecasts that
collaborative robots will take the lead in the robotics industry
in the upcoming years [10].
Advanced Sensing and Perception and Navigation
Guidance systems: Force torque sensing to vision systems
allow robots to work freely and collaboratively with humans,
rather than in isolated environments.
