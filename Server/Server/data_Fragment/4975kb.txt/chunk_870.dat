Transcription (ATM) than other characteristics such as Mel
Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). At same time,
Vector Quantization (VQ), Hidden Markov Models (HMM),
Gaussian Mixtures Models (GMM) and Artificial Neural
Networks (ANN) for pattern classification task were used. The
database consisted of 840 music notes, we analyzed 5 scales and
14 samples by musical note. The results obtained showed that
Vector Quatization, HMM using CMCC_L&B_RA and GMM
were the best methods of Artificial Inteligent for this task,
while MFCC and CMCC_L&B_RA were the best features
employed.

I. INTRODUCTION
Signal processing techniques, and information
technology in general, have undergone several scientific
advances which permit us to address the very complex
problem of Automatic Music Transcription (AMT). During
the last twenty years, the interest in AMT has increased
rapidly, and the time has come for some articles and books
overview of this subject [1][2].
AMT is a multifaceted problem, comprising several
subtasks: rhythm analysis, multiple funda-mental frequency
analysis, sound source separation, musical instrument
classification, and integration of all these into entire systems.
AMT is, in addition, deeply rooted in fundamental signal
processing.
Music transcription refers to the analysis of an acoustic
musical signal so as to write down the pitch, onset time,
duration, and source of each sound that occurs in it. In
Western tradition, writ-ten music uses note symbols to
indicate these parameters in a piece of music. Figures 1 and 2
show the notation of an example music signal. Omitting the
details, the main conventions are that time flows from left to
right and the pitch of the notes is indicated by their vertical
position on the staff lines. The loudness (and the applied
instrument in the case of pitched instruments) is normal-ly
not specified for individual notes but is determined for larger
