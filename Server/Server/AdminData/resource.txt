company. As one of the contestants put it, “We were 
charging through the rice paddies, not stopping for 
anything and taking no prisoners.” The takeover was the 
largest in history and generated almost $1 billion in fees 
for the banks and advisers. (Chapter 21)
1993 Inflation Financial managers need to recognize the 
effect of inflation on interest rates and on the profitability 
of the firm’s investments. In the United States inflation has 
been relatively modest, but some countries have suffered 
from hyperinflation. In Hungary after World War II, the government issued banknotes worth 1,000 trillion pengoes. In 
Yugoslavia in October 1993, prices rose by nearly 2,000% 
and a dollar bought 105 million dinars. The inflation rate in 
Venezuela in late 2015 was about 180%. (Chapter 5)
1780 and 1997 Inflation-Indexed Debt In 1780, Massachusetts paid Revolutionary War soldiers with interest-bearing 
notes rather than its rapidly eroding currency. Interest and 
principal payments on the notes were tied to the subsequent rate of inflation. After a 217-year hiatus, the U.S. 
Treasury issued inflation-indexed notes called TIPS 
(Treasury Inflation Protected Securities). Many other countries, including Britain and Israel, had done so previously.

1993 Controlling Risk When a company fails to keep close 
tabs on the risks being taken by its employees, it can get 
into serious trouble. This was the fate of Barings, a 
220-year-old British bank that numbered the queen among 
its clients. In 1993 it discovered that Nick Leeson, a trader 
in its Singapore office, had hidden losses of $1.3 billion 
(£869 million) from unauthorized bets on the Japanese 
equity market. The losses wiped out Barings and landed 
Leeson in jail, with a 6-year sentence. In 2008 a rogue 
trader at Morgan Stanley established a new record by losing $9 billion on unauthorized deals. (Chapter 24)
1999 The Euro Large corporations do business in many 
currencies. In 1999 a new currency came into existence 
when 11 European countries adopted the euro in place of 
their separate currencies. They have since been joined by

SUMMARY
Financial management can be broken down into (1) the investment or capital budgeting 
decision and (2) the financing decision. The firm has to decide (1) which real assets to 
invest in and (2) how to raise the funds necessary to pay for those investments.
Real assets include all assets used in the production or sale of the firms’ products or 
services. They can be tangible (plant and equipment, for example) or intangible (patents 
or trademarks, for example). In contrast, financial assets (such as stocks or bonds) are 
claims on the income generated by real assets.
Corporations are distinct, permanent legal entities. They allow for separation of ownership and control, and they can continue operating without disruption even as management 
or ownership changes. They provide limited liability to their owners. On the other hand, 
What are the two major 
decisions made by financial 
managers? (LO1-1)
What does “real asset” 
mean? (LO1-2)
What are the advantages 
and disadvantages of 
forming a corporation?

26 Part One Introduction
managing the corporation’s legal machinery is costly. Also, corporations are subject to 
double taxation, because they pay taxes on their profits and the shareholders are taxed 
again when they receive dividends or sell their shares at a profit.
Almost all managers are involved to some degree in investment decisions, but some managers specialize in finance, for example, the treasurer, controller, and CFO. The treasurer
is most directly responsible for raising capital and maintaining relationships with banks 
and investors that hold the firm’s securities. The controller is responsible for preparing 
financial statements and managing budgets. In large firms, a chief financial officer
oversees both the treasurer and the controller and is involved in financial policymaking and 
corporate planning.
Value maximization is the natural financial goal of the firm. Shareholders can invest 
or consume the increased wealth as they wish, provided that they have access to 
well-functioning financial markets.
Companies either can invest in real assets or can return the cash to shareholders, who can 
invest it for themselves. The return that shareholders can earn for themselves is called the 
opportunity cost of capital. Companies create value for shareholders whenever they can 
earn a higher return on their investments than the opportunity cost of capital.
Conflicts of interest between managers and stockholders can lead to agency problems
and agency costs. Agency problems are kept in check by financial controls, by welldesigned compensation packages for managers, and by effective corporate governance.
Shareholders do not want the maximum possible stock price; they want the maximum 
honest price. But there need be no conflict between value maximization and ethical behavior. The surest route to maximum value starts with products and servic
