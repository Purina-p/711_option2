Like mutual funds, hedge funds also pool the savings of different investors and 
invest on their behalf. But they differ from mutual funds in at least two ways. First, 
because hedge funds usually follow complex, high-risk investment strategies, access is 
usually restricted to knowledgeable investors such as pension funds, endowment funds, 
and wealthy individuals. Don’t try to send a check for $3,000 or $5,000 to a hedge 
fund; most hedge funds are not in the “retail” investment business. Second, hedge 
funds try to attract the most talented managers by compensating them with potentially 
lucrative, performance-related fees.4
 In contrast, mutual funds usually charge a fixed 
percentage of assets under management.
Hedge funds follow many different investment strategies. Some try to make a profit 
by identifying overvalued stocks or markets and selling short. (We will not go into 
procedures for short-selling here. Just remember that short-sellers profit when prices 
fall.5
) “Vulture funds” specialize in the securities of distressed corporations. Some 
hedge funds take bets on firms involved in merger negotiations, others look for mispriced convertible bonds, and some take positions in currencies and interest rates. 
Hedge funds manage less money than mutual funds, but they sometimes take very big 
positions and have a large impact on the market.
There are other ways of pooling and investing savings. Consider a pension plan set 
up by a corporation or other organization on behalf of its employees. There are several 
types of pension plan. The most common type of plan is the defined-contribution plan.
