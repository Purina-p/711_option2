or a new product launch, the financial manager needs to think clearly about the cost of the capital 
that the firm raises from outside investors. As we pointed 
out in Chapter 1, the opportunity cost of capital for the 
firm is the rate of return that its stockholders expect to 
get by investing on their own in financial markets. This 
means that the financial manager must understand how 
prices are determined in the financial markets in order 
to make wise investment decisions.
Financial markets and institutions are the firm’s financial environment. You don’t have to know everything 
about that environment to begin the study of financial 
management, but a general understanding provides 
useful context for the work ahead. For example, it will 
help you to understand why you are calculating the 
yield to maturity of a bond in Chapter 6, the net present 
value of a capital investment in Chapter 9, or the 
weighted-average cost of capital for a company in 
Chapter 13.
This chapter does three things. First, it surveys financial markets and institutions. We will cover the stock and 
bond markets, banks and insurance companies, and 
mutual and pension funds. Second, we will set out the 
functions of financial markets and institutions and look 
at how they help corporations and the economy. Third, 
we will discuss the financial crisis of 2007–2009 and 
the eurozone crisis that followed. An understanding of 
what happens when financial markets do not function 
well is important for understanding why and how financial markets and institutions matter.

The Importance of Financial Markets 
and Institutions
In the previous chapter, we explained why corporations need to be good at finance in 
order to survive and prosper. All corporations face important investment and financing 
decisions. But, of course, those decisions are not made in a vacuum. They are made in 
a financial environment. That environment has two main segments: financial markets 
and financial institutions.
Businesses have to go to financial markets and institutions for the financing they 
need to grow. When they have a surplus of cash, and no need for immediate financing, 
they have to invest the cash, for example, in bank accounts or in securities. Let’s take 
Apple Computer Inc. as an example.
Table 2.1 presents a time line for Apple and examples of the sources of financing 
tapped by Apple from its start-up in a California garage in 1976 to its cash-rich status 
in 2016. The initial investment in Apple stock was $250,000. Apple was also able to 
get short-term financing from parts suppliers who did not demand immediate payment. 
Apple got the parts, assembled and sold the computers, and afterward paid off its 
accounts payable to the suppliers. (We discuss accounts payable in Chapter 19.) Then,

financing decisions by Apple 
Computer
April 1976: Apple Computer 
Inc. founded
Mike Makkula, Apple’s first chairman, invests $250,000 in 
Apple shares.
1976: First 200 computers 
sold
Parts suppliers give Apple 30 days to pay. (Financing from 
accounts payable.)
1978–79 Apple raises $3.5 million from venture capital investors.
December 1980: Initial 
public offering
Apple raises $91 million, after fees and expenses, by selling 
shares to public investors.
May 1981 Apple sells 2.6 million additional shares at $31.25 per share.
April 1987 Apple pays its first dividend at an annual rate of $.12 per share.
Early 1990s Apple carries out several share repurchase programs.
1994 Apple issues $300 million of debt at an interest rate of 6.5%.
1996–97: Apple reports a 
$740 million loss in the 
second quarter of 1996. Lays 
off 2,700 employees in 1997.
Dividend is suspended in February 1996. Apple sells $661 
million of debt to private investors in June 1996. The 
borrowing provides “sufficient liquidity” to execute Apple’s 
strategic plans and to “return the company to profitability.”
September 1997: Acquires 
assets of Power Computing 
Corp.
Acquisition is financed with $100 million of Apple stock.
2004: Apple is healthy and 
profitable, thanks to iMac, 
iPod, and other products.
Apple pays off the $300 million in long-term debt issued in 
1994, leaving the company with no long-term debt 
outstanding.
2005–13 Apple’s profits grow rapidly. It invests in marketable securities, 
which accumulate to $147 billion by June 2013.
2012–13 Apple announces plans to pay out $100 billion to 
shareholders over the next 3 years. It also borrows a record 
$17 billion.
2013–15 Apple’s Capital Return Program distributes cash to 
shareholders by paying dividends and repurchasing shares. 
The planned total distribution is $200 billion by 2017.
2015 Apple issues $14.5 billion in dollar-denominated debt, 
€4.8 billion in euro debt, as well as debt issued in U.K. 
pounds, Swiss francs, and Japanese yen.
February 2016 Apple’s market capitalization, the total market value of all 
its outstanding shares, is $521 billion, far in excess of the 
$119 billion cumulative investment by Apple’s shareholders. 
The cumulative investment includes $92 billion of retained 
earnings.

as Apple grew, it was able to obtain several rounds of financing by selling Apple shares 
to private venture capital investors. (We discuss venture capital in Chapter 15.) In 
December 1980, it raised $91 million in an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares to 
public investors. There was also a follow-up share issue in May 1981.1
After Apple became a public company, it could raise financing from many sources, 
and it was able to pay for acquisitions by issuing more shares. We show a few examples in Table 2.1.
Apple started paying cash dividends to shareholders in 1987, and it also distributed 
cash to investors by stock repurchases in the early 1990s. But Apple hit a rough patch 
in 1996 and 1997, and regular dividends were eliminated. The company had to borrow 
$661 million from a group of private investors in order to cover its losses and finance 
its recovery plan. However, the rough patch ended with the release of the iMac in 1998 
and the iPod in 2001. Apple’s profitability increased rapidly, and it was able to finance 
its growth by plowing back earnings into operations. These retained earnings had 
grown to $92 billion by September 2015.
As the twenty-first century progressed, Apple’s profits grew so fast that it piled up 
a cash mountain, which grew to more than $200 billion by 2016. It resumed cash dividends and started a massive program of share repurchases. Its Capital Return Program, 
which began in 2012, will distribute $200 billion in cash to its shareholders by 2017.
Apple is well known for its product innovations, including the Macintosh computer, 
the iPhone, and the iPad. Apple is not special because of financing. In fact, the story of 
its financing is not too different from that of many other successful companies. But 
access to financing was vital to Apple’s growth and profitability. Would we have iMac 
computers, iPhones, or iPads if Apple had been forced to operate in a country with a 
primitive financial system? Definitely not. A prosperous economy requires a wellfunctioning financial system.
A modern financial system offers financing in many different forms, depending on 
the company’s age, its growth rate, and the nature of its business. For example, Apple 
relied on venture capital financing in its early years and only later floated its shares in 
public stock markets. Still later, as the company matured, it turned to other forms of 
financing, including the examples given in Table 2.1. But the table does not begin to 
cover the range of financing channels open to modern corporations. We will encounter 
many other channels later in the book, and new channels are opening up regularly. The 
nearby box describes one recent financial innovation, micro-lending funds that make 
small loans to businesspeople in the poorer parts of the world.
The Flow of Savings to Corporations
The money that corporations invest in real assets comes ultimately from savings 
by investors. But there can be many stops on the road between savings and corporate investment. The road can pass through financial markets, financial intermediaries, or both.
Let’s start with the simplest case of a small, closely held corporation, like Apple in 
its earliest years. The orange arrows in Figure 2.1 show the flow of savings from shareholders in this simple setting. There are two possible paths: The firm can sell new 
shares, or it can reinvest cash back into the firm’s operations. Reinvestment means 
additional savings by existing shareholders. The reinvested cash could have been paid 
out to those shareholders and spent by them on personal consumption. By not taking 
and spending the cash, shareholders have reinvested their savings in the corporation.

 Many of the shares sold in the 1981 issue were previously held by Apple employees. Sale of these shares 
allowed the employees to cash out and diversify some of their Apple holdings but did not raise additional 
financing for Apple.

The interest rates on these micro loans are relatively high; 
this is because the cost of writing and administering such 
small loans is high and the loans are made in nations with 
weak currencies. However, default rates on the loans are only 
about 4%. “There is a deep pride in keeping up with payments,” says Deidre Wagner, an executive vice president of 
Starbucks, who invested $100,000 in a microfinance fund in 
2003. “In some instances, when an individual is behind on 
payments, others in the village may make up the difference.” 
Investors and borrowers know that when the micro loans are 
repaid, the money gets recycled into new loans, giving still 
more borrowers a chance to move up the economic ladder.

Vahid Hujdur had dreams of opening his own business. With 
about $200 of his own money and a $1,500 loan, he was able 
to rent space in the old section of Sarajevo, and he began 
repairing and selling discarded industrial sewing machines. 
After just 8 years, Hujdur has 10 employees building, installing, 
and fixing this industrial machinery. Hujdur didn’t get his initial 
loan from a local bank. “They were asking for guarantees that 
were impossible to get,” he recalls. Instead, the capital came 
from LOKmicro, a local financial institution specializing in 
microfinance—the lending of small amounts to the poor in 
developing nations to help them launch small enterprises.
Microfinance institutions get capital from individual and 
institutional investors via microfinance funds, which collect 
the investors’ money, vet the local lenders, offer them management assistance, and administer investors’ accounts.

Cash retained and reinvested in the firm’s operations is cash saved and invested 
on behalf of the firm’s shareholders.
Of course, a small corporation has other financing choices. It could take out a bank 
loan, for example. The bank in turn may have raised money by attracting savings 
accounts. In this case, investors’ savings flow through the bank to the firm.
Now consider a large, public corporation, for example, Apple Computer in 
September 2015. What’s different? Scale, for one thing: Apple’s annual revenues for 
the previous 12 months were $234 billion, and its balance sheet showed total assets of 
$290 billion. The scope of Apple’s activities has also expanded: It now has dozens of 
product lines and operates worldwide. Because of this scale and scope, Apple attracts 
investors’ savings by a variety of different routes. It can do so because it is a large, 
profitable, public firm.
The flow of savings to large public corporations is shown in Figure 2.2. Notice two 
key differences from Figure 2.1. First, public corporations can draw savings from investors worldwide. Second, the savings flow through financial markets, financial intermediaries, or both. Suppose, for example, that Bank of America raises $900 million by a 
new issue of shares. An Italian investor buys 4,000 of the new shares for $15 per share. 
Now Bank of America takes that $60,000, along with money raised by the rest of the 
issue, and makes a $300 million loan to Apple. The Italian investor’s savings end up 
flowing through financial markets (the stock market), to a financial intermediary (Bank 
of America), and finally to Apple.
Of course, our Italian friend’s $60,000 doesn’t literally arrive at Apple in an envelope marked “From L. DaVinci.” Investments by the purchasers of the Bank of 
America’s stock issue are pooled, not segregated. Signor DaVinci would own a share 
of all of Bank of America’s assets, not just one loan to Apple. Nevertheless, investors’ 
savings are flowing through the financial markets and the bank to finance Apple’s 
capital investments.
