The interest rates on these micro loans are relatively high; 
this is because the cost of writing and administering such 
small loans is high and the loans are made in nations with 
weak currencies. However, default rates on the loans are only 
about 4%. “There is a deep pride in keeping up with payments,” says Deidre Wagner, an executive vice president of 
Starbucks, who invested $100,000 in a microfinance fund in 
2003. “In some instances, when an individual is behind on 
payments, others in the village may make up the difference.” 
Investors and borrowers know that when the micro loans are 
repaid, the money gets recycled into new loans, giving still 
more borrowers a chance to move up the economic ladder.

Vahid Hujdur had dreams of opening his own business. With 
about $200 of his own money and a $1,500 loan, he was able 
to rent space in the old section of Sarajevo, and he began 
repairing and selling discarded industrial sewing machines. 
After just 8 years, Hujdur has 10 employees building, installing, 
and fixing this industrial machinery. Hujdur didn’t get his initial 
loan from a local bank. “They were asking for guarantees that 
were impossible to get,” he recalls. Instead, the capital came 
from LOKmicro, a local financial institution specializing in 
microfinance—the lending of small amounts to the poor in 
developing nations to help them launch small enterprises.
Microfinance institutions get capital from individual and 
institutional investors via microfinance funds, which collect 
the investors’ money, vet the local lenders, offer them management assistance, and administer investors’ accounts.
